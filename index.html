VALEO, SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, ET AL.</b> </p> <div class="posture"> <b>APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.</b> <p class="paragraph"></p> </div> <p class="docket"> No. 75-436. </p> <p class="date"> Argued November 10, 1975. Decided January 30, 1976.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idm155344-fn_">_ </a></sup> </p> <div class="syllabus"> <p class="paragraph">The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), as amended in 1974, (a) limits political contributions to candidates for federal elective office by an individual or a group to $1,000 and by a political committee to $5,000 to any single candidate per election, with an overall annual limitation of $25,000 by an individual contributor; (b) limits expenditures by individuals or groups "relative to a clearly identified candidate" to $1,000 per candidate per election, and by a candidate from his personal or family funds to various specified annual amounts depending upon the federal office sought, and restricts overall general election and primary campaign expenditures by candidates to various specified amounts, again depending upon the federal office sought; (c) requires political committees to keep detailed records of contributions and expenditures, including the name and address of each individual contributing in excess of $10, and his occupation and <span class="page_number" data-page="2">*2</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="2">2</span> principal place of business if his contribution exceeds $100, and to file quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission disclosing the source of every contribution exceeding $100 and the recipient and purpose of every expenditure over $100, and also requires every individual or group, other than a candidate or political committee, making contributions or expenditures exceeding $100 "other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate" to file a statement with the Commission; and (d) creates the eight-member Commission as the administering agency with recordkeeping, disclosure, and investigatory functions and extensive rulemaking, adjudicatory, and enforcement powers, and consisting of two members appointed by the President <i>pro</i> <i>tempore</i> of the Senate, two by the Speaker of the House, and two by the President (all subject to confirmation by both Houses of Congress), and the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House as <i>ex officio</i> nonvoting members. Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC), as amended in 1974, provides for public financing of Presidential nominating conventions and general election and primary campaigns from general revenues and allocates such funding to conventions and general election campaigns by establishing three categories: (1) "major" parties (those whose candidate received 25% or more of the vote in the most recent election), which receive full funding, (2) "minor" parties (those whose candidate received at least 5% but less than 25% of the votes at the last election), which receive only a percentage of the funds to which the major parties are entitled; and (3) "new" parties (all other parties), which are limited to receipt of post-election funds or are not entitled to any funds if their candidate receives less than 5% of the vote. A primary candidate for the Presidential nomination by a political party who receives more than $5,000 from private sources (counting only the first $250 of each contribution) in each of at least 20 States is eligible for matching public funds. Appellants (various federal officeholders and candidates, supporting political organizations, and others) brought suit against appellees (the Secretary of the Senate, Clerk of the House, Comptroller General, Attorney General, and the Commission) seeking declaratory and injective relief against the above statutory provisions on various constitutional grounds. The Court of Appeals, on certified questions from the District Court, upheld all but one of the statutory provisions. A three-judge District Court upheld the constitutionality of Subtitle H. <i>Held:</i> <span class="page_number" data-page="3">*3</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="3">3</span> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> 1. This litigation presents an Art. III "case or controversy," since the complaint discloses that at least some of the appellants have a sufficient "personal stake" in a determination of the constitutional validity of each of the challenged provisions to present "a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts." <i>Aetna Life Ins.

Pp. 11-12.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> 2. The Act's contribution provisions are constitutional, but the expenditure provisions violate the First Amendment. Pp. 12-59.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (a) The contribution provisions, along with those covering disclosure, are appropriate legislative weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large campaign contributions, and the ceilings imposed accordingly serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion. Pp. 23-38.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (b) The First Amendment requires the invalidation of the Act's independent expenditure ceiling, its limitation on a candidate's expenditures from his own personal funds, and its ceilings on overall campaign expenditures, since those provisions place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Pp. 39-59.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> 3. The Act's disclosure and recordkeeping provisions are constitutional. Pp. 60-84.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (a) The general disclosure provisions, which serve substantial governmental interests in informing the electorate and preventing the corruption of the political process, are not overbroad insofar as they apply to contributions to minor parties and independent candidates. No blanket exemption for minor parties is warranted since such parties in order to prove injury as a result of application to them of the disclosure provisions need show only a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party's contributors' names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals in violation of their First Amendment associational rights. Pp. 64-74.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (b) The provision for disclosure by those who make independent <span class="page_number" data-page="4">*4</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="4">4</span> contributions and expenditures, as narrowly construed to apply only (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent to some person other than a candidate or political committee and (2) when they make an expenditure for a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate is not unconstitutionally vague and does not constitute a prior restraint but is a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering First Amendment values by public exposure of the federal election system. Pp. 74-82.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (c) The extension of the recordkeeping provisions to contributions as small as those just above $10 and the disclosure provisions to contributions above $100 is not on this record overbroad since it cannot be said to be unrelated to the informational and enforcement goals of the legislation. Pp. 82-84.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> 4. Subtitle H of the IRC is constitutional. Pp. 85-109. </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (a) Subtitle H is not invalid under the General Welfare Clause but, as a means to reform the electoral process, was clearly a choice within the power granted to Congress by the Clause to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare. Pp. 90-92.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (b) Nor does Subtitle H violate the First Amendment. Rather than abridging, restricting, or censoring speech, it represents an effort to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process. Pp. 92-93.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (c) Subtitle H, being less burdensome than ballot-access regulations and having been enacted in furtherance of vital governmental interests in relieving major-party candidates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions, in not funding candidates who lack significant public support, and in eliminating reliance on large private contributions for funding of conventions and campaigns, does not invidiously discriminate against minor and new parties in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 93-108.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> (d) Invalidation of the spending-limit provisions of the Act does not render Subtitle H unconstitutional, but the Subtitle is severable from such provisions and is not dependent upon the existence of a generally applicable expenditure limit. Pp. 108-109.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> 5. The Commission's composition as to all but its investigative and informative powers violates Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. With respect to the Commission's powers, all of which are ripe for review, <span class="page_number" data-page="5">*5</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="5">5</span> to enforce the Act, including primary responsibility for bringing civil actions against violators, to make rules for carrying out the Act, to temporarily disqualify federal candidates for failing to file required reports, and to authorize convention expenditures in excess of the specified limits, the provisions of the Act vesting such powers in the Commission and the prescribed method of appointment of members of the Commission to the extent that a majority of the voting members are appointed by the President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, violate the Appointments Clause, which provides in pertinent part that the President shall nominate, and with the Senate's advice and consent appoint, all "Officers of the United States," whose appointments are not otherwise provided for, but that Congress may vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as it deems proper, in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments. Hence (though the Commission's past acts are accorded <i>de facto</i> validity and a stay is granted permitting it to function under the Act for not more than 30 days), the Commission, as presently constituted, may not because of that Clause exercise such powers, which can be exercised only by "Officers of the United States" appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause, although it may exercise such investigative and informative powers as are in the same category as those powers that Congress might delegate to one of its own committees.

The defendants included the Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, both in their official capacities and as <i>ex officio</i> members of the Federal Election Commission. The Commission itself was named as a defendant. Also named were the Attorney General of the United States and the Comptroller General of the United States. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, 2201, and 2202, and § 315(a) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. § 437h (a) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp387104-fn4">4 </a></sup> The complaint sought both a <span class="page_number" data-page="9">*9</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="9">9</span> declaratory judgment that the major provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and an injunction against enforcement of those provisions. Appellants requested the convocation of a three-judge District Court as to all matters and also requested certification of constitutional questions to the Court of Appeals, pursuant to the terms of § 315(a). The District Judge denied the application for a three-judge court and directed that the case be transmitted to the Court of Appeals. That court entered an order stating that the case was "preliminarily deemed" to be properly certified under § 315(a). Leave to intervene was granted to various groups and individuals.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp389216-fn5">5 </a></sup> After considering matters regarding factfinding procedures, the Court of Appeals entered an order en banc remanding the case to the District Court to (1) identify the constitutional issues in the complaint; (2) take whatever evidence was found necessary in addition to the submissions suitably dealt with by way of judicial notice; (3) make findings of fact with reference to those issues; and (4) certify the constitutional questions arising from the foregoing steps to the Court of Appeals.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp390112-fn6">6 </a></sup> On remand, the District <span class="page_number" data-page="10">*10</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="10">10</span> Judge entered a memorandum order adopting extensive findings of fact and transmitting the augmented record back to the Court of Appeals. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">4.</div><p id="idp387104-fn4" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 8 "§ 437h.

The court suggested that a three-judge District Court should consider the constitutionality of these provisions in order to protect against the contingency that this Court might eventually hold these issues to be subject to determination by a three-judge court, either under § 9011(b), or 28 U.S.C. § 2282, <span class="page_number" data-page="10">*10</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="10">10</span> 2284. <span class="unlinked-ref">171 U.S.App.D.C. 168, 170</span>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-3?page=819">519 F.2d 817, 819</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-3?page=819"></a> (1975). The case was argued simultaneously to both the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, and a three-judge District Court. The three-judge court limited its consideration to issues under Subtitle H. The three-judge court adopted the Court of Appeals' opinion on these questions <i>in toto</i> and simply entered an order with respect to those matters. <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-5">401 F. Supp. 1235</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-5"></a>. Thus, two judgments are before us — one from each court — upholding the constitutionality of Subtitle H, though the two cases before the Court will generally be referred to hereinafter in the singular. Since the jurisdiction of this Court to hear at least one of the appeals is clear, we need not resolve the jurisdictional ambiguities that occasioned the joint sitting of the Court of Appeals and the three-judge court.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> On plenary review, a majority of the Court of Appeals rejected, for the most part, appellants' constitutional attacks. The court found "a clear and compelling interest," <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=192">171 U.S. App. D.C., at 192</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=192"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=841">519 F.2d, at 841</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=841"></a>, in preserving the integrity of the electoral process. On that basis, the court upheld, with one exception,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp392096-fn7">7 </a></sup> the substantive provisions of the Act with respect to contributions, expenditures, and disclosure. It also sustained the constitutionality of the newly established Federal Election Commission.

See n. 157, <i>infra</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> In this Court, appellants argue that the Court of Appeals failed to give this legislation the critical scrutiny demanded under accepted First Amendment and equal protection principles. In appellants' view, limiting the use of money for political purposes constitutes a restriction on communication violative of the First Amendment, since virtually all meaningful political communications in the modern setting involve the expenditure of money. Further, they argue that the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Act unconstitutionally impinge on their right to freedom of association. Appellants also view the federal subsidy provisions of Subtitle H as violative of the General Welfare Clause, and as inconsistent with the First and Fifth Amendments. Finally, appellants renew their attack on the Commission's composition and powers. </p> <p class="paragraph"> At the outset we must determine whether the case before us presents a "case or controversy" within the meaning of Art.

See Part III, <i>infra</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> A. General Principles </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Act's contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities. Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order "to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people." <i>Roth</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/roth-v-united-states-alberts-v-state-of-california?page=484">354 U.S. 476, 484</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/roth-v-united-states-alberts-v-state-of-california?page=484"></a> (1957). Although First Amendment protections are not confined to "the exposition of ideas," <i>Winters</i> v. <i>New York</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/winters-v-new-york?page=510">333 U.S. 507, 510</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/winters-v-new-york?page=510"></a> (1948), "there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course includ[ing] discussions of candidates . . . ." <i>Mills</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/mills-v-alabama?page=218">384 U.S. 214, 218</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/mills-v-alabama?page=218"></a> (1966). This no more than reflects our "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," <i>New York Times Co</i>. v. <i>Sullivan</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/new-york-times-company-v-sullivan?page=270">376 U.S. 254, 270</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/new-york-times-company-v-sullivan?page=270"></a> (1964). In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates <span class="page_number" data-page="15">*15</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="15">15</span> for office is essential, for the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a nation. As the Court observed in <i>Monitor Patriot Co</i>. v. <i>Roy</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy?page=272">401 U.S. 265, 272</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy?page=272"></a> (1971), "it can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office." </p> <p class="paragraph"> The First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression. The constitutional right of association explicated in <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/national-association-for-advancement-of-colored-people-v-state-of-alabama-patterson?page=460">357 U.S. 449,460</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/national-association-for-advancement-of-colored-people-v-state-of-alabama-patterson?page=460"></a> (1958), stemmed from the Court's recognition that "[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association." Subsequent decisions have made clear that the First andFourteenth Amendments guarantee "`freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas,'" a freedom that encompasses "`[t]he right to associate with the political party of one's choice.'" <i>Kusper</i> v. <i>Pontikes</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/kusper-v-pontikes?page=56">414 U.S. 51, 56, 57</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/kusper-v-pontikes?page=56"></a> (1973), quoted in <i>Cousins</i> v. <i>Wigoda</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/cousins-v-wigoda-2?page=487">419 U.S. 477, 487</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/cousins-v-wigoda-2?page=487"></a> (1975). </p> <p class="paragraph"> It is with these principles in mind that we consider the primary contentions of the parties with respect to the Act's limitations upon the giving and spending of money in political campaigns. Those conflicting contentions could not more sharply define the basic issues before us. Appellees contend that what the Act regulates is conduct, and that its effect on speech and association is incidental at most. Appellants respond that contributions and expenditures are at the very core of political speech, and that the Act's limitations thus constitute restraints on First Amendment liberty that are both gross and direct. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In upholding the constitutional validity of the Act's contribution and expenditure provisions on the ground <span class="page_number" data-page="16">*16</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="16">16</span> that those provisions should be viewed as regulating conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals relied upon <i>United States</i> v. <i>O'Brien</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-obrien-3">391 U.S. 367</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-obrien-3"></a> (1968). See <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=191">171 U.S. App. D.C., at 191</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=191"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=840">519 F.2d, at 840</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=840"></a>. The <i>O'Brien</i> case involved a defendant's claim that the First Amendment prohibited his prosecution for burning his draft card because his act was "`symbolic speech'" engaged in as a "`demonstration against the war and against the draft.'"<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-obrien-3?page=376">391 U.S., at 376</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-obrien-3?page=376"></a>. On the assumption that "the alleged communicative element in O'Brien's conduct [was] sufficient to bring into play the First Amendment," the Court sustained the conviction because it found "a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the non-speech element" that was "unrelated to the suppression of free expression" and that had an "incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms . . . no greater than [was] essential to the furtherance of that interest." <i>Id.</i>, at 376-377. The Court expressly emphasized that <i>O'Brien</i> was not a case "where the alleged governmental interest in regulating conduct arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful." <i>Id.</i>, at 382. </p> <p class="paragraph"> We cannot share the view that the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations are comparable to the restrictions on conduct upheld in <i>O'Brien</i>. The expenditure of money simply cannot be equated with such conduct as destruction of a draft card. Some forms of communication made possible by the giving and spending of money involve speech alone, some involve conduct primarily, and some involve a combination of the two. Yet this Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a non speech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by theFirst Amendment. See <i>Bigelow</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/bigelow-v-virginia?page=820">421 U.S. 809, <span class="page_number" data-page="17">*17</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="17">17</span> 820</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/bigelow-v-virginia?page=820"></a> (1975); <i>New York Times Co</i>. v. <i>Sullivan, supra</i>, at 266. For example, in <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/cox-v-louisiana-2">379 U.S. 559</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/cox-v-louisiana-2"></a> (1965), the Court contrasted picketing and parading with a newspaper comment and a telegram by a citizen to a public official. The parading and picketing activities were said to constitute conduct "intertwined with expression and association," whereas the newspaper comment and the telegram were described as a "pure form of expression" involving "free speech alone" rather than "expression mixed with particular conduct." <i>Id.</i>, at 563-564. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Even if the categorization of the expenditure of money as conduct were accepted, the limitations challenged here would not meet the <i>O'Brien</i> test because the governmental interests advanced in support of the Act involve "suppressing communication." The interests served by the Act include restricting the voices of people and interest groups who have money to spend and reducing the overall scope of federal election campaigns. Although the Act does not focus on the ideas expressed by persons or groups subject to its regulations, it is aimed in part at equalizing the relative ability of all voters to affect electoral outcomes by placing a ceiling on expenditures for political expression by citizens and groups. Unlike <i>O'Brien</i>, where the Selective Service System's administrative interest in the preservation of draft cards was wholly unrelated to their use as a means of communication, it is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the alleged "conduct" of giving or spending money "arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful." <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-obrien-3?page=382">391 U.S., at 382</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-obrien-3?page=382"></a>. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Nor can the Act's contribution and expenditure limitations be sustained, as some of the parties suggest, by reference to the constitutional principles reflected in such <span class="page_number" data-page="18">*18</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="18">18</span> decisions as <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Louisiana, supra; Adderley</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/adderley-v-state-of-florida">385 U.S. 39</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/adderley-v-state-of-florida"></a> (1966); and <i>Kovacs</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/kovacs-v-cooper">336 U.S. 77</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/kovacs-v-cooper"></a> (1949). Those cases stand for the proposition that the government may adopt reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, which do not discriminate among speakers or ideas, in order to further an important governmental interest unrelated to the restriction of communication. See <i>Erznoznik</i> v. <i>City of Jacksonville</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/erznoznik-v-city-of-jacksonville-8212-1942?page=209">422 U.S. 205,209</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/erznoznik-v-city-of-jacksonville-8212-1942?page=209"></a> (1975). In contrast to <i>O'Brien</i>, where the method of expression was held to be subject to prohibition, <i>Cox, Adderley</i>, and <i>Kovacs</i> involved place or manner restrictions on legitimate modes of expression — picketing, parading, demonstrating, and using a soundtruck. The critical difference between this case and those time, place, and manner cases is that the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable time, place, and manner regulations otherwise imposed.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp451376-fn17">17 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="19">*19</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="19">19</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">17.</div><p id="idp451376-fn17" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 18 The nongovernmental appellees argue that just as the decibels emitted by a sound truck can be regulated consistently with theFirst Amendment, <i>Kovacs</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/kovacs-v-cooper">336 U.S. 77</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/kovacs-v-cooper"></a> (1949), the Act may restrict the volume of dollars in political campaigns without impermissibly restricting freedom of speech. See Freund, Commentary in A. Rosenthal, Federal Regulation of Campaign Finance: Some Constitutional Questions 72 (1971). This comparison underscores a fundamental misconception. The decibel restriction upheld in <i>Kovacs</i> limited the <i>manner</i> of operating a soundtruck, but not the <i>extent</i> of its proper use. By contrast, the Act's dollar ceilings restrict the extent of the reasonable use of virtually every means of communicating information. As the <i>Kovacs</i> Court emphasized, the nuisance ordinance only barred soundtrucks from broadcasting "in a loud and raucous manner on the streets," <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/kovacs-v-cooper?page=89">336 U.S., at 89</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/kovacs-v-cooper?page=89"></a>, and imposed "no restriction upon the communication of ideas or discussion of issues by the human voice, by newspapers, by pamphlets, by dodgers," or by soundtrucks operating at a reasonable volume. <i>Ibid</i>. See <i>Saia</i> v. <i>New York</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/saia-v-people-of-state-of-new-york?page=561">334 U.S. 558, 561-562</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/saia-v-people-of-state-of-new-york?page=561"></a> (1948).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp452560-fn18">18 </a></sup> This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event.

The 1972 senatorial figures showed that 18 of 66 major-party candidates exceeded the Act's limitations.

The data for House of Representatives elections are also skewed, since statistics reflect a combined $168,000 limit instead of separate $70,000 ceilings for primary and general elections with up to an additional 20% permitted for fundraising. §§ 591(f)(4)(H), 608(c)(1)(E). Only 22 of the 810 major-party House candidates in 1974 and 20 of the 816 major-party candidates in 1972 exceeded the $168,000 figure. Both Presidential candidates in 1972 spent in excess of the combined Presidential expenditure ceilings. §§ 608(c)(1)(A), (B).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> By contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication. <span class="page_number" data-page="21">*21</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="21">21</span> A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.

Making a contribution, like joining a political party, serves to affiliate a person with a candidate. In addition, it enables like-minded persons to pool their resources in furtherance of common political goals. The Act's contribution ceilings thus limit one important means of associating with a candidate or committee, but leave the contributor free to become a member of any political association and to assist personally in the association's efforts on behalf of candidates. And the Act's contribution limitations permit associations and candidates to aggregate large sums of money to promote effective advocacy. By contrast, the Act's $1,000 limitation on independent expenditures "relative to a clearly identified candidate" precludes most associations from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents, the original basis for the recognition of First Amendment protection of the freedom of association.

The statute defines "person" broadly to include "an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation or any other organization or group of persons." § 591(g). The limitation reaches a gift, subscription, loan, advance, deposit of anything of value, or promise to give a contribution, made for the purpose of influencing a primary election, a Presidential preference primary, or a general election for any federal office.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp471824-fn24">24 </a></sup> §§ 591(e)(1), (2).

See <i>infra</i>, at 36-37. <br> The Act does not define the phrase — "for the purpose of influencing" an election — that determines when a gift, loan, or advance constitutes a contribution.

Even a "`significant interference' with protected rights of political association" may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms. <i>Cousins</i> v. <i>Wigoda, supra</i>, at 488; <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Button, supra</i>, at 438; <i>Shelton</i> v. <i>Tucker, supra</i>, at 488. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellees argue that the Act's restrictions on large campaign contributions are justified by three governmental interests. According to the parties and <i>amici</i>, the primary interest served by the limitations and, indeed, by the Act as a whole, is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates' positions and on their actions if elected to office. Two "ancillary" interests underlying the Act are also allegedly furthered by the $1,000 limits on contributions. First, the limits serve to mute the voices of affluent persons and groups in the election <span class="page_number" data-page="26">*26</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="26">26</span> process and thereby to equalize the relative ability of all citizens to affect the outcome of elections.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp490608-fn26">26 </a></sup> Second, it is argued, the ceilings may to some extent act as a brake on the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns and thereby serve to open the political system more widely to candidates without access to sources of large amounts of money.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp491248-fn27">27 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">26.</div><p id="idp490608-fn26" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 26 Contribution limitations alone would not reduce the greater potential voice of affluent persons and well-financed groups, who would remain free to spend unlimited sums directly to promote candidates and policies they favor in an effort to persuade voters.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">27.</div><p id="idp491248-fn27" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 26 Yet, a ceiling on the size of contributions would affect only indirectly the costs of political campaigns by making it relatively more difficult for candidates to raise large amounts of money. In 1974, for example, 94.9% of the funds raised by candidates for Congress came from contributions of $1,000 or less, see n. 23, <i>supra</i>. Presumably, some or all of the contributions in excess of $1,000 could have been replaced through efforts to raise additional contributions from persons giving less than $1,000. It is the Act's campaign expenditure limitations, § 608(c), not the contribution limits, that directly address the overall scope of federal election spending.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose — to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions — in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. The increasing importance of the communications media and sophisticated mass-mailing and polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising of large sums of money an ever more essential ingredient of an effective candidacy. To the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <i>quid pro quo</i> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of <span class="page_number" data-page="27">*27</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="27">27</span> representative democracy is undermined. Although the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained, the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem is not an illusory one.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp494656-fn28">28 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">28.</div><p id="idp494656-fn28" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 27 The Court of Appeals' opinion in this case discussed a number of the abuses uncovered after the 1972 elections.

Here, as there, Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence "is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent." <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/csc-v-letter-carriers?page=565">413 U.S., at 565</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/csc-v-letter-carriers?page=565"></a>.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp497664-fn29">29 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">29.</div><p id="idp497664-fn29" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 27 Although the Court in <i>Letter Carriers</i> found that this interest was constitutionally sufficient to justify legislation prohibiting federal employees from engaging in certain partisan political activities, it was careful to emphasize that the limitations did not restrict an employee's right to express his views on political issues and candidates.<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/csc-v-letter-carriers?page=561">413 U.S., at 561, 568, 575-576, 579</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/csc-v-letter-carriers?page=561"></a>.

As a prime example, § 610 permits corporations and labor unions to establish segregated funds to solicit voluntary contributions to be utilized for political purposes. Corporate and union resources without limitation may be employed to administer these funds and to solicit contributions from employees, stockholders, and union members. Each separate fund may contribute up to $5,000 per candidate per election so long as the fund qualifies as a political committee under § 608(b)(2). See S. Rep.

Reg. 56584 (1975). <br> The Act places no limit on the number of funds that may be formed through the use of subsidiaries or divisions of corporations, or of local and regional units of a national labor union. The potential for proliferation of these sources of contributions is not insignificant. In 1972, approximately 1,824,000 active corporations filed federal income tax returns. Internal Revenue Service, Preliminary Statistics of Income 1972, Corporation Income Tax Returns, p. 1 (pub. 159 (11-74)). (It is not clear whether this total includes subsidiary corporations where the parent filed a consolidated return.) In the same year, 71,409 local unions were chartered by national unions. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Directory of National Unions and Employee Associations 1973, p. 87 (1974). <br> The Act allows the maximum contribution to be made by each unit's fund provided the decision or judgment to contribute to particular candidates is made by the fund independently of control or direction by the parent corporation or the national or regional union. See S. Rep. No. 93-1237, pp. 51-52 (1974).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> We find that, under the rigorous standard of review established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests served by restricting the size of financial contributions to political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited effect upon First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 contribution ceiling. </p> <p class="paragraph"> (b) </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants' first overbreadth challenge to the contribution ceilings rests on the proposition that most large contributors do not seek improper influence over a candidate's position or an officeholder's action. Although the truth of that proposition may be assumed, it does not <span class="page_number" data-page="30">*30</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="30">30</span> undercut the validity of the $1,000 contribution limitation. Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated. </p> <p class="paragraph"> A second, related overbreadth claim is that the $1,000 restriction is unrealistically low because much more than that amount would still not be enough to enable an unscrupulous contributor to exercise improper influence over a candidate or officeholder, especially in campaigns for statewide or national office. While the contribution limitation provisions might well have been structured to take account of the graduated expenditure limitations for congressional and Presidential campaigns,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp505824-fn32">32 </a></sup> Congress' failure to engage in such fine tuning does not invalidate the legislation. As the Court of Appeals observed, "[i]f it is satisfied that some limit on contributions is necessary, a court has no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000." <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=193">171 U.S. App. D.C., at 193</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=193"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=842">519 F.2d, at 842</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=842"></a>.

Absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions. Cf. <i>James</i> v. <i>Valtierra</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/james-v-valtierra">402 U.S. 137</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/james-v-valtierra"></a> (1971). <span class="page_number" data-page="32">*32</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="32">32</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">33.</div><p id="idp510960-fn33" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 31 In this discussion, we address only the argument that the contribution limitations alone impressibly discriminate against non-incumbents. We do not address the more serious argument that these limitations, in combination with the limitation on expenditures by individuals and groups, the limitation on a candidate's use of his own personal and family resources, and the overall ceiling on campaign expenditures invidiously discriminate against major-party challengers and minor-party candidates. <br> Since an incumbent is subject to these limitations to the same degree as his opponent, the Act, on its face, appears to be even-handed. The appearance of fairness, however, may not reflect political reality. Although some incumbents are defeated in every congressional election, it is axiomatic that an incumbent usually begins the race with significant advantages. In addition to the factors of voter recognition and the status accruing to holding federal office, the incumbent has access to substantial resources provided by the Government. These include local and Washington offices, staff support, and the franking privilege. Where the incumbent has the support of major special-interest groups which have the flexibility described in n. 31, <i>supra</i>, and is further supported by the media, the overall effect of the contribution and expenditure limitations enacted by Congress could foreclose any fair opportunity of a successful challenge. <br> However, since we decide in Part I-C, <i>infra</i>, that the ceilings on independent expenditures, on the candidate's expenditures from his personal funds, and on overall campaign expenditures are unconstitutional under the First Amendment, we need not express any opinion with regard to the alleged invidious discrimination resulting from the full sweep of the legislation as enacted.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> There is no such evidence to support the claim that the contribution limitations in themselves discriminate against major-party challengers to incumbents.

Even these 10 contributions would have been permissible under the Act if the donor did not earmark the funds for a particular candidate and did not exceed the overall $25,000 contribution ceiling for the calendar year. See § 608(b). Similarly, appellants Conservative Victory Fund and American Conservative Union have received only an insignificant portion of their funding through contributions in excess of $1,000. The affidavit of the executive director of the Conservative Victory Fund indicates that in 1974, a typical fundraising year, the Fund received approximately $152,000 through over 9,500 individual contributions. Only one of the 9,500 contributions, an $8,000 contribution earmarked for a particular candidate, exceeded $1,000. In 1972, the Fund received only three contributions in excess of $1,000, all of which might have been legal under the Act if not earmarked. And between April 7, 1972, and February 28, 1975, the American Conservative Union did not receive any aggregate contributions exceeding $1,000. Moreover, the Committee for a Constitutional Presidency — McCarthy '76, another appellant, engaged in a concerted effort to raise contributions in excess of $1,000 before the effective date of the Act but obtained only five contributions in excess of $1,000. <br> Although appellants claim that the $1,000 ceiling governing contributions to candidates will prevent the acquisition of seed money necessary to launch campaigns, the absence of experience under the Act prevents us from evaluating this assertion.

The $5,000 Limitation on Contributions by Political Committees </p> <p class="paragraph"> Section 608(b)(2) permits certain committees, designated as "political committees," to contribute up to $5,000 to any candidate with respect to any election for federal office. In order to qualify for the higher contribution ceiling, a group must have been registered with the Commission as a political committee under2 U.S.C. § 433 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) for not less than six months, have received contributions from more than 50 persons, and, except for state political party organizations, have contributed to five or more candidates for federal office. Appellants argue that these qualifications unconstitutionally discriminate against <i>ad hoc</i> organizations in favor of established interest groups and impermissibly burden free association. The argument is without merit. Rather than undermining freedom of association, the basic provision enhances the opportunity of bona fide groups to participate in the election process, and the registration, contribution, and candidate conditions serve the permissible purpose of preventing individuals <span class="page_number" data-page="36">*36</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="36">36</span> from evading the applicable contribution limitations by labeling themselves committees. </p> <p class="paragraph"> 3. Limitations on Volunteers' Incidental Expenses </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Act excludes from the definition of contribution "the value of services provided without compensation by individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee." § 591(e)(5)(A). Certain expenses incurred by persons in providing volunteer services to a candidate are exempt from the $1,000 ceiling only to the extent that they do not exceed $500. These expenses are expressly limited to (1) "the use of real or personal property and the cost of invitations, food, and beverages, voluntarily provided by an individual to a candidate in rendering voluntary personal services on the individual's residential premises for candidate-related activities." § 591(e)(5)(B); (2) "the sale of any food or beverage by a vendor for use in a candidate's campaign at a charge [at least equal to cost but] less than the normal comparable charge," § 591(e)(5)(C); and (3) "any unreimbursed payment for travel expenses made by an individual who on his own behalf volunteers his personal services to a candidate," § 591(e)(5)(D). </p> <p class="paragraph"> If, as we have held, the basic contribution limitations are constitutionally valid, then surely these provisions are a constitutionally acceptable accommodation of Congress' valid interest in encouraging citizen participation in political campaigns while continuing to guard against the corrupting potential of large financial contributions to candidates. The expenditure of resources at the candidate's direction for a fundraising event at a volunteer's residence or the provision of in-kind assistance in the form of food or beverages to be resold to raise funds or consumed by the participants in such an event provides material financial assistance to a candidate. The ultimate <span class="page_number" data-page="37">*37</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="37">37</span> effect is the same as if the person had contributed the dollar amount to the candidate and the candidate had then used the contribution to pay for the fundraising event or the food. Similarly, travel undertaken as a volunteer at the direction of the candidate or his staff is an expense of the campaign and may properly be viewed as a contribution if the volunteer absorbs the fare. Treating these expenses as contributions when made to the candidate's campaign or at the direction of the candidate or his staff forecloses an avenue of abuse<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp529664-fn42">42 </a></sup> without limiting actions voluntarily undertaken by citizens independently of a candidate's campaign.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp530160-fn43">43 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="38">*38</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="38">38</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">42.</div><p id="idp529664-fn42" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 37 Although expenditures incidental to volunteer services would appear self-limiting, it is possible for a worker in a candidate's campaign to generate substantial travel expenses. An affidavit submitted by Stewart Mott, an appellant, indicates that he "expended some $50,000 for personal expenses" in connection with Senator McGovern's 1972 Presidential campaign.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">43.</div><p id="idp530160-fn43" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 37 The Act contains identical, parallel provisions pertaining to incidental volunteer expenses under the definitions of contribution and expenditure. Compare §§ 591(e)(5)(B)-(D) with §§ 591(f)(4) (D), (E). The definitions have two effects. First, volunteer expenses that are counted as contributions by the volunteer would also constitute expenditures by the candidate's campaign. Second, some volunteer expenses would qualify as contributions whereas others would constitute independent expenditures. The statute distinguishes between independent expenditures by individuals and campaign expenditures on the basis of whether the candidate, an authorized committee of the candidate, or an agent of the candidate "authorized or requested" the expenditure. See §§ 608(c)(2)(B) (ii), (e)(1); S. Rep. No. 93-689, p. 18 (1974); H.R. Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 6 (1974). As a result, only travel that is "authorized or requested" by the candidate or his agents would involve incidental expenses chargeable against the volunteer's contribution limit and the candidate's expenditure ceiling. See n. 53, <i>infra</i>. Should a person independently travel across the country to participate in a campaign, any unreimbursed travel expenses would not be treated as a contribution. This interpretation is not only consistent with the statute <span class="page_number" data-page="38">*38</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="38">38</span> and the legislative history but is also necessary to avoid the administrative chaos that would be produced if each volunteer and candidate had to keep track of amounts spent on unsolicited travel in order to comply with the Act's contribution and expenditure ceilings and the reporting and disclosure provisions. The distinction between contributions and expenditures is also discussed at n. 53, <i>infra</i>, and in Part II-C-2, <i>infra</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> 4. The $25,000 Limitation on Total Contributions During any Calendar Year </p> <p class="paragraph"> In addition to the $1,000 limitation on the nonexempt contributions that an individual may make to a particular candidate for any single election, the Act contains an overall $25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar year. § 608(b)(3). A contribution made in connection with an election is considered, for purposes of this subsection, to be made in the year the election is held. Although the constitutionality of this provision was drawn into question by appellants, it has not been separately addressed at length by the parties. The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support. But this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's political party. The limited, additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid. <span class="page_number" data-page="39">*39</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="39">39</span> </p> <p class="paragraph"> C. Expenditure Limitations </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Act's expenditure ceilings impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech. The most drastic of the limitations restricts individuals and groups, including political parties that fail to place a candidate on the ballot,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp535392-fn44">44 </a></sup> to an expenditure of $1,000 "relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year." § 608(e)(1). Other expenditure ceilings limit spending by candidates, § 608(a), their campaigns, § 608(c), and political parties in connection with election campaigns, § 608(f). It is clear that a primary effect of these expenditure limitations is to restrict the quantity of campaign speech by individuals, groups, and candidates. The restrictions, while neutral as to the ideas expressed, limit political expression "at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms." <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Rhodes</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/williams-v-rhodes?page=32">393 U.S. 23, 32</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/williams-v-rhodes?page=32"></a> (1968). </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">44.</div><p id="idp535392-fn44" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 39 See n. 19, <i>supra</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> 1.

The most important exclusions are: (1) "any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate," § 591(f)(4) <span class="page_number" data-page="40">*40</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="40">40</span> (A), and (2) "any communication by any membership organization or corporation to its members or stockholders, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office," § 591(f)(4)(C).

Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp554848-fn50">50 </a></sup> In an analogous <span class="page_number" data-page="43">*43</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="43">43</span> context, this Court in <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Collins</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/thomas-v-collins-2">323 U.S. 516</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/thomas-v-collins-2"></a> (1945), observed: </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">50.</div><p id="idp554848-fn50" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 42 In connection with another provision containing the same advocacy language appearing in § 608(e)(1), the Court of Appeals concluded: <br> "Public discussion of public issues which also are campaign issues readily and often unavoidably draws in candidates and their positions, their voting records and other official conduct.

The Court of Appeals summarily held the provision constitutionally valid on the ground that "section 608(e) is a loophole-closing provision only" that is necessary to prevent circumvention of the contribution limitations. <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=204">171 U.S.App.D.C., at 204</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=204"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=853">519 F.2d, at 853</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=853"></a>. We cannot agree. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The discussion in Part I-A, <i>supra</i>, explains why the Act's expenditure limitations impose far greater restraints on the freedom of speech and association than do its contribution limitations. The markedly greater burden on basic freedoms caused by § 608(e)(1) thus cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations. Rather, the constitutionality of § 608(e)(1) turns on whether the governmental interests advanced in its support satisfy the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations <span class="page_number" data-page="45">*45</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="45">45</span> on core First Amendment rights of political expression. </p> <p class="paragraph"> We find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify § 608(e)(1)'s ceiling on independent expenditures. First, assuming, <i>arguendo</i>, that large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements as do large contributions, § 608(e)(1) does not provide an answer that sufficiently relates to the elimination of those dangers. Unlike the contribution limitations' total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates, § 608(e)(1) prevents only some large expenditures. So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views. The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation's effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or office-holder. It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate's campaign. Yet no substantial societal interest would be served by a loophole-closing provision designed to check corruption that permitted unscrupulous persons and organizations to expend unlimited sums of money in order to obtain improper influence over candidates for elective office. Cf. <i>Mills</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/mills-v-alabama?page=220">384 U.S., at 220</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/mills-v-alabama?page=220"></a>. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Second, quite apart from the shortcomings of § 608(e) <span class="page_number" data-page="46">*46</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="46">46</span> (1) in preventing any abuses generated by large independent expenditures, the independent advocacy restricted by the provision does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions. The parties defending § 608(e)(1) contend that it is necessary to prevent would-be contributors from avoiding the contribution limitations by the simple expedient of paying directly for media advertisements or for other portions of the candidate's campaign activities. They argue that expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign might well have virtually the same value to the candidate as a contribution and would pose similar dangers of abuse. Yet such controlled or coordinated expenditures are treated as contributions rather than expenditures under the Act.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp577328-fn53">53 </a></sup> Section 608(b)'s <span class="page_number" data-page="47">*47</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="47">47</span> contribution ceilings rather than § 608(e)(1)'s independent expenditure limitation prevent attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions. By contrast, § 608(e)(1) limits expenditures for express advocacy of candidates made totally independently of the candidate and his campaign. Unlike contributions, such independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for improper commitments from the candidate. Rather than preventing circumvention of the contribution limitations, § 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent advocacy despite its substantially diminished potential for abuse. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">53.</div><p id="idp577328-fn53" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 46 Section 608(e)(1) does not apply to expenditures "on behalf of a candidate" within the meaning of § 608(c)(2)(B). The latter subsection provides that expenditures "authorized or requested by the candidate, an authorized committee of the candidate, or an agent of the candidate" are to be treated as expenditures of the candidate and contributions by the person or group making the expenditure. The House and Senate Reports provide guidance in differentiating individual expenditures that are contributions and candidate expenditures under § 608(c)(2)(B) from those treated as independent expenditures subject to the § 608(e)(1) ceiling. The House Report speaks of independent expenditures as costs "incurred without the request or consent of a candidate or his agent." H.R. Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 6 (1974). The Senate Report addresses the issue in greater detail. It provides an example illustrating the distinction between "authorized or requested" expenditures excluded from § 608(e)(1) and independent expenditures governed by § 608(e)(1): <br> "[A] person might purchase billboard advertisements endorsing a candidate. If he does so completely on his own, and not at the request or suggestion of the candidate or his agent's [ <i>sic</i>] that would constitute an `independent expenditure on behalf of a candidate' <span class="page_number" data-page="47">*47</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="47">47</span> under section 614(c) of the bill. The person making the expenditure would have to report it as such. <br> "However, if the advertisement was placed in cooperation with the candidate's campaign organization, then the amount would constitute a gift by the supporter and an expenditure by the candidate — just as if there had been a direct contribution enabling the candidate to place the advertisement, himself. It would be so reported by both." S. Rep. No. 93-689, p. 18 (1974). <br> The Conference substitute adopted the provision of the Senate bill dealing with expenditures by any person "authorized or requested" to make an expenditure by the candidate or his agents. S. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1237, p. 55 (1974). In view of this legislative history and the purposes of the Act, we find that the "authorized or requested" standard of the Act operates to treat all expenditures placed in cooperation with or with the consent of a candidate, his agents, or an authorized committee of the candidate as contributions subject to the limitations set forth in § 608(b).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> While the independent expenditure ceiling thus fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming <span class="page_number" data-page="48">*48</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="48">48</span> the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process, it heavily burdens core First Amendment expression.

These voting cases and the reapportionment decisions serve to assure that citizens are accorded an equal right to vote for their representatives regardless of factors of wealth or geography. But the principles that underlie invalidation of governmentally imposed restrictions on the franchise do not justify governmentally imposed restrictions on political expression. Democracy depends on a well-informed electorate, not a citizenry legislatively limited in its ability to discuss and debate candidates and issues. <br> In <i>Red Lion Broadcasting Co</i>. v. <i>FCC</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/red-lion-broadcasting-co-v-fcc">395 U.S. 367</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/red-lion-broadcasting-co-v-fcc"></a> (1969), the Court upheld the political-editorial and personal-attack portions of <span class="page_number" data-page="50">*50</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="50">50</span> the Federal Communications Commission's fairness doctrine. That doctrine requires broadcast licensees to devote programing time to the discussion of controversial issues of public importance and to present both sides of such issues. <i>Red Lion</i> "makes clear that the broadcast media pose unique and special problems not present in the traditional free speech case," by demonstrating that "`it is idle to posit an unbridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish.'" <i>Columbia Broadcasting</i> v. <i>Democratic Comm.</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/columbia-broadcasting-v-democratic-comm?page=101">412 U.S. 94,101</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/columbia-broadcasting-v-democratic-comm?page=101"></a> (1973), quoting <i>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., supra</i>, at 388. <i>Red Lion</i> therefore undercuts appellees' claim that § 608(e) (1)'s limitations may permissibly restrict the First Amendment rights of individuals in this "traditional free speech case."

However, unlike a person's contribution to a candidate, a candidate's expenditure of his personal funds directly facilitates his own political speech.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> The primary governmental interest served by the Act — the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process — does not support the limitation on the candidate's expenditure of his own personal funds. As the Court of Appeals concluded: "Manifestly, the core problem of avoiding undisclosed and undue influence on candidates from outside interests has lesser application when the monies involved come from the candidate himself or from his immediate family." <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=206">171 U.S.App.D.C., at 206</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=206"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=855">519 F.2d, at 855</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=855"></a>. Indeed, the use of personal funds reduces the candidate's dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which the Act's contribution limitations are directed.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2316864-fn59">59 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="54">*54</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="54">54</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">59.</div><p id="idp2316864-fn59" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 53 The legislative history of the Act clearly indicates that § 608(a) was not intended to suspend the application of the $1,000 contribution limitation of § 608(b)(1) for members of the candidate's immediate family. See n. 57, <i>supra</i>. Although the risk of improper influence is somewhat diminished in the case of large contributions from immediate family members, we cannot say that the danger is sufficiently reduced to bar Congress from subjecting family members to the same limitations as nonfamily contributors. <br> The limitation on a candidate's expenditure of his own funds differs markedly from a limitation on family contributions both in the absence of any threat of corruption and the presence of a legislative <span class="page_number" data-page="54">*54</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="54">54</span> restriction on the candidate's ability to fund his own communication with the voters.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> The ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office, therefore, provides the sole relevant rationale for § 608(a)'s expenditure ceiling. That interest is clearly not sufficient to justify the provision's infringement of fundamentalFirst Amendment rights. First, the limitation may fail to promote financial equality among candidates. A candidate who spends less of his personal resources on his campaign may nonetheless outspend his rival as a result of more successful fundraising efforts. Indeed, a candidate's personal wealth may impede his efforts to persuade others that he needs their financial contributions or volunteer efforts to conduct an effective campaign. Second, and more fundamentally, theFirst Amendment simply cannot tolerate § 608(a)'s restriction upon the freedom of a candidate to speak without legislative limit on behalf of his own candidacy. We therefore hold that § 608(a)'s restriction on a candidate's personal expenditures is unconstitutional. </p> <p class="paragraph"> 3. Limitations on Campaign Expenditures </p> <p class="paragraph"> Section 608(c) places limitations on overall campaign expenditures by candidates seeking nomination for election and election to federal office.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2320832-fn60">60 </a></sup> Presidential candidates may spend $10,000,000 in seeking nomination for office and an additional $20,000,000 in the general election campaign. §§ 608(c)(1)(A), (B).<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2321568-fn61">61 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="55">*55</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="55">55</span> The ceiling on senatorial campaigns is pegged to the size of the voting-age population of the State with minimum dollar amounts applicable to campaigns in States with small populations. In senatorial primary elections, the limit is the greater of eight cents multiplied by the voting-age population or $100,000, and in the general election the limit is increased to 12 cents multiplied by the voting-age population or $150,000. §§ 608(c)(1)(C), (D). The Act imposes blanket $70,000 limitations on both primary campaigns and general election campaigns for the House of Representatives with the exception that the senatorial ceiling applies to campaigns in States entitled to only one Representative. §§ 608(c)(1)(C)-(E). These ceilings are to be adjusted upwards at the beginning of each calendar year by the average percentage rise in the consumer price index for the 12 preceding months. § 608(d).<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2323680-fn62">62 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">60.</div><p id="idp2320832-fn60" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 54 Expenditures made by an authorized committee of the candidate or any other agent of the candidate as well as any expenditure by any other person that is "authorized or requested" by the candidate or his agent are charged against the candidate's spending ceiling. § 608(c)(2)(B).</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">61.</div><p id="idp2321568-fn61" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 54 Expenditures made by or on behalf of a Vice Presidential candidate of a political party are considered to have been made by or on behalf of the party's Presidential candidate. § 608(c)(2)(A).</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">62.</div><p id="idp2323680-fn62" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 55 The campaign ceilings contained in § 608(c) would have required a reduction in the scope of a number of previous congressional campaigns and substantially limited the overall expenditures of the two major-party Presidential candidates in 1972.

The major evil associated with rapidly increasing campaign expenditures is the danger of candidate dependence on large contributions. The interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by the Act's contribution limitations and disclosure provisions rather than by § 608(c)'s campaign expenditure ceilings. The Court of Appeals' assertion that the expenditure restrictions are necessary to reduce the incentive to circumvent direct contribution limits is not persuasive.

There is no indication that the substantial criminal penalties for violating the contribution ceilings combined with the political repercussion of such violations will be insufficient to police the contribution provisions. Extensive reporting, auditing, and disclosure requirements applicable to both contributions and expenditures by political campaigns are designed to facilitate the detection of illegal contributions. Moreover, as the Court of Appeals noted, the Act permits an officeholder or successful candidate to retain contributions in excess of the expenditure ceiling and to use these funds for "any other lawful purpose." 2 U.S.C. § 439a (1970 ed., Supp. IV). This provision undercuts whatever marginal role the expenditure limitations might otherwise play in enforcing the contribution ceilings. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates competing for federal office is no more convincing a justification for restricting the scope of federal election campaigns. Given the limitation on the size of outside contributions, the financial resources available to a candidate's campaign, like the number of volunteers recruited, will normally vary with the size and intensity of the candidate's support.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2328160-fn63">63 </a></sup> There is nothing invidious, improper, or unhealthy in permitting such funds to be spent to carry the candidate's message to the electorate.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2328704-fn64">64 </a></sup> Moreover, the equalization of permissible campaign expenditures <span class="page_number" data-page="57">*57</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="57">57</span> might serve not to equalize the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">63.</div><p id="idp2328160-fn63" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 56 This normal relationship may not apply where the candidate devotes a large amount of his personal resources to his campaign.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">64.</div><p id="idp2328704-fn64" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 56 As an opinion dissenting in part from the decision below noted: "If a senatorial candidate can raise $1 from each voter, what evil is exacerbated by allowing that candidate to use all that money for political communication?

Appellees and the Court of Appeals stressed statistics indicating that spending for federal election campaigns increased almost 300% between 1952 and 1972 in comparison with a 57.6% rise in the consumer price index during the same period. Appellants respond that during these years the rise in campaign spending lagged behind the percentage increase in total expenditures for commercial advertising and the size of the gross national product. In any event, the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending and the resulting limitation on the scope of federal campaigns. TheFirst Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government, but the people — individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees — who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2332160-fn65">65 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="58">*58</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="58">58</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">65.</div><p id="idp2332160-fn65" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 57 For the reasons discussed in Part III, <i>infra</i>, Congress may engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations.

Appellants do not challenge these ceilings on First Amendment grounds. Instead, they contend that the provisions discriminate against independent candidates and regional political parties without national committees because they permit additional spending by political parties with national committees. Our decision today holding § 608(e)(1)'s independent expenditure limitation unconstitutional and § 608(c)'s campaign expenditure ceilings unconstitutional removes the predicate for appellants' discrimination claim by eliminating any alleged advantage to political parties with national committees.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> In sum, the provisions of the Act that impose a $1,000 limitation on contributions to a single candidate, § 608(b)(1), a $5,000 limitation on contributions by a political committee to a single candidate, § 608(b)(2), and a $25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar year, § 608(b)(3), are constitutionally valid. These limitations, along with the disclosure provisions, constitute the Act's primary weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large campaign contributions. The contribution ceilings thus serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion. By contrast, the First Amendment requires the invalidation of the Act's independent expenditure ceiling, § 608(e)(1), its limitation on a candidate's expenditures from his own personal funds, § 608(a), and its ceilings on overall campaign expenditures, § 608(c).

Moreover, the <i>O'Brien</i> test would not be met, even if it were applicable. <i>O'Brien</i> requires that "the governmental interest [be] unrelated to the suppression of free expression." <i>Id.</i>, at 377. The governmental interest furthered by the disclosure requirements is not unrelated to the "suppression" of speech insofar as the requirements are designed to facilitate the detection of violations of the contribution and expenditure limitations set out in 18 U.S.C. § 608 (1970 ed., Supp. IV).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> As we have seen, group association is protected because it enhances "[e]ffective advocacy." <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Alabama, supra</i>, at 460.

Moreover, the invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when the information sought concerns the giving and spending of money as when it concerns the joining of organizations, for "[f]inancial transactions can reveal much about a person's activities, associations, and beliefs." <i>California Bankers Assn</i>. v. <i>Shultz</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/california-bankers-assn-v-shultz?page=78">416 U.S. 21, 78-79</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/california-bankers-assn-v-shultz?page=78"></a> (1974) (POWELL, J., concurring). Our past decisions have not drawn fine lines between contributors and members but have treated them interchangeably. In <i>Bates</i>, for example, we applied the principles of <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Alabama</i> and reversed convictions for failure to comply with a city ordinance that required the disclosure of "dues, assessments, and contributions paid, by whom and when paid." <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/bates-v-city-of-little-rock?page=518">361 U.S., at 518</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/bates-v-city-of-little-rock?page=518"></a>.

They fall into three categories. First, disclosure provides the electorate with information "as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate"<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2388752-fn77">77 </a></sup> in order to aid the voters in evaluating those <span class="page_number" data-page="67">*67</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="67">67</span> who seek federal office. It allows voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches. The sources of a candidate's financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">77.</div><p id="idp2388752-fn77" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 66 H.R.

Under those circumstances, the Court held that "whatever interest the State may have in [disclosure] has not been shown to be sufficient to overcome petitioner's constitutional objections." <i>Id.</i>, at 465. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court of Appeals rejected appellants' suggestion that this case fits into the <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Alabama</i> mold.

As minor parties usually represent definite and publicized viewpoints, there may be less need to inform the voters of the interests that specific candidates represent. Major parties encompass candidates of greater diversity. In many situations the label "Republican" or "Democrat" tells a voter little. The candidate who bears it may be supported by funds from the far right, the far left, or any place in between on the political spectrum. It is less likely that a candidate of, say, the Socialist Labor Party will represent interests that cannot be discerned from the party's ideological position. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Government's interest in deterring the "buying" of elections and the undue influence of large contributors on officeholders also may be reduced where contributions to a minor party or an independent candidate are concerned, for it is less likely that the candidate will be victorious. But a minor party sometimes can play a significant role in an election. Even when a minor-party candidate has little or no chance of winning, he may be encouraged by major-party interests in order to divert votes from other major-party contenders.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2409936-fn84">84 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="71">*71</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="71">71</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">84.</div><p id="idp2409936-fn84" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 70 See Developments in the Law — Elections, 88 Harv.

The proof may include, for example, specific evidence of past or present harassment of members due to their associational ties, or of harassment directed against the organization itself.

But the disclosure provisions, including § 434(e), serve another, informational interest, and even as construed § 434(e) increases the fund of information concerning those who support the candidates. It goes beyond the general disclosure requirements to shed the light of publicity on spending that is unambiguously campaign related but would not otherwise be reported because it takes the form of independent expenditures or of contributions to an individual or group not itself required to report the names of its contributors. By the same token, it is not fatal that § 434(e) encompasses purely independent expenditures uncoordinated with a particular candidate or his agent. The corruption potential of these expenditures may be significantly different, but the informational interest can be as strong as it is in coordinated spending, for disclosure helps voters to define more of the candidates' constituencies. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Section 434(e), as we have construed it, does not contain the infirmities of the provisions before the Court in <i>Talley</i> v. <i>California</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/talley-v-state-of-california">362 U.S. 60</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/talley-v-state-of-california"></a> (1960), and <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Collins</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/thomas-v-collins-2">323 U.S. 516</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/thomas-v-collins-2"></a> (1945).

If a person's contributions to a committee or candidate aggregate more than $100, his name and address, as well as his occupation and principal place of business, are to be included in reports filed by committees and candidates with the Commission, § 434(b)(2), and made available for public inspection, § 438(a)(4). </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court of Appeals rejected appellants' contention that these thresholds are unconstitutional. It found the challenge on First Amendment grounds to the $10 threshold to be premature, for it could "discern no basis in the statute for authorizing disclosure outside the Commission <span class="page_number" data-page="83">*83</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="83">83</span> . . ., and hence no substantial `inhibitory effect' operating upon" appellants. <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=216">171 U.S. App. D.C., at 216</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=216"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=865">519 F.2d, at 865</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=865"></a>. The $100 threshold was found to be within the "reasonable latitude" given the legislature "as to where to draw the line." <i>Ibid</i>. We agree. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The $10 and $100 thresholds are indeed low. Contributors of relatively small amounts are likely to be especially sensitive to recording or disclosure of their political preferences. These strict requirements may well discourage participation by some citizens in the political process, a result that Congress hardly could have intended. Indeed, there is little in the legislative history to indicate that Congress focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require recording and disclosure. Rather, it seems merely to have adopted the thresholds existing in similar disclosure laws since 1910.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2487520-fn110">110 </a></sup> But we cannot require Congress to establish that it has chosen the highest reasonable threshold.

We find no merit in these contentions. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants'"general welfare" contention erroneously treats the General Welfare Clause as a limitation upon congressional power. It is rather a grant of power, the scope of which is quite expansive, particularly in view of the enlargement of power by the Necessary and Proper Clause. <i>M`Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, <span class="unlinked-ref">4 Wheat. 316, 420</span> (1819). Congress has power to regulate Presidential elections and primaries, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Classic</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-classic">313 U.S. 299</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-classic"></a> (1941); <i>Burroughs</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us">290 U.S. 534</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us"></a> (1934); and public financing of Presidential elections as a means to reform the electoral process was clearly a choice within the granted power. It is for Congress to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare: "[T]he power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not <span class="page_number" data-page="91">*91</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="91">91</span> limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution." <i>United States</i> v. <i>Butler</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-butler-12?page=66">297 U.S. 1,66</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-butler-12?page=66"></a> (1936).

Any limitations upon the exercise of that granted power must be found elsewhere in the Constitution. In this case, Congress was legislating for the "general welfare" — to reduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process, to facilitate communication by candidates with the electorate, and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising. See S. Rep. No. 93-689, Pp. 1-10 (1974). Whether the chosen means appear "bad," "unwise," or "unworkable" to us is irrelevant; Congress has concluded that the means are "necessary and proper" to promote the general welfare, and we thus decline to find this legislation without the grant of power in Art. I, § 8. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants' challenge to the dollar check-off provision (§ 6096) fails for the same reason. They maintain that Congress is required to permit taxpayers to designate particular candidates or parties as recipients of their money.

Further, insofar as these proposals are offered as less restrictive means, Congress had legitimate reasons for rejecting both. The designation option was criticized on privacy grounds, 119 Cong.

We have, of course, held that the Religion Clauses — "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" — require Congress, and the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, to remain neutral in matters of religion. <i>E. g., Abington School Dist</i>. v. <i>Schempp</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/school-district-of-abington-township-pennsylvania-v-schempp-murray-iii-v-curlett?page=222">374 U.S. 203, 222-226</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/school-district-of-abington-township-pennsylvania-v-schempp-murray-iii-v-curlett?page=222"></a> (1963). The government may not aid one religion to the detriment of others or impose a burden on one religion that is not imposed on others, and may not even aid all religions. <i>E. g., Everson</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/everson-v-board-of-education-of-ewing-tp?page=15">330 U.S. 1, 15-16</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/everson-v-board-of-education-of-ewing-tp?page=15"></a> (1947). See Kurland, Of Church and State and the Supreme Court, 29 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 96 (1961). But the analogy is patently inapplicable to our issue here. Although "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or the press," Subtitle H is a congressional effort, not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public <span class="page_number" data-page="93">*93</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="93">93</span> discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a self-governing people.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2533056-fn126">126 </a></sup> Thus, Subtitle H furthers, not abridges, pertinent First Amendment values.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2533920-fn127">127 </a></sup> Appellants argue, however, that as constructed public financing invidiously discriminates in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

These cases, however, dealt primarily with state laws requiring a candidate to satisfy certain requirements in order to have his name appear on the ballot. These were, of course, direct burdens not only on the candidate's ability to run for office but also on the voter's ability to voice preferences regarding representative government and contemporary issues. In contrast, the denial of public financing to some Presidential candidates is not restrictive of voters' rights and less restrictive of candidates'.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2544480-fn128">128 </a></sup> Subtitle H does not prevent any candidate from getting on the ballot or any voter from casting a vote for the candidate of his choice; the inability, if any, of minor-party candidates to wage effective campaigns will derive not from lack of public funding but from their inability to <span class="page_number" data-page="95">*95</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="95">95</span> raise private contributions. Any disadvantage suffered by operation of the eligibility formulae under Subtitle H is thus limited to the claimed denial of the enhancement of opportunity to communicate with the electorate that the formulae afford eligible candidates. But eligible candidates suffer a countervailing denial. As we more fully develop later, acceptance of public financing entails voluntary acceptance of an expenditure ceiling. Non-eligible candidates are not subject to that limitation.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2546064-fn129">129 </a></sup> Accordingly, we conclude that public financing is generally less restrictive of access to the electoral process than the ballot-access regulations dealt with in prior cases.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2546640-fn130">130 </a></sup> In any event, Congress enacted Subtitle H in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests and has <span class="page_number" data-page="96">*96</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="96">96</span> not unfairly or unnecessarily burdened the political opportunity of any party or candidate. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">128.</div><p id="idp2544480-fn128" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 94 Appellants maintain that denial of funding is a more severe restriction than denial of access to the ballot, because write-in candidates can win elections, but candidates without funds cannot.

Texas required major parties — there called "political parties" — to nominate candidates by primaries, and the State reimbursed the parties for some of the expenses incurred in holding the primaries. But Texas did not subsidize other parties for the expenses involved in qualifying for the ballot, and this denial was claimed to be a denial of equal protection of the laws. We said that we were "unconvinced . . . that this financing law is an `exclusionary mechanism' which `tends to deny some voters the opportunity to vote for a candidate of their choosing' or that it has `a real and appreciable impact on the exercise of the franchise.'" <i>Id.</i>, at 794, quoting from <i>Bullock</i> v. <i>Carter</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/bullock-v-carter?page=144">405 U.S., at 144</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/bullock-v-carter?page=144"></a>.

S. Rep. No. 93-689, pp. 4-5 (1974). In addition, the limits on contributions necessarily increase the burden of fundraising, and Congress properly regarded public financing as an appropriate means of relieving major-party Presidential candidates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions. See <i>id.</i>, at 5. The States have also been held to have important interests in limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate substantial popular support. <i>E. g., Storer</i> v. <i>Brown, supra</i>, at 736; <i>Lubin</i> v. <i>Panish, supra</i>, at 718-719; <i>Jenness</i> v. <i>Fortson</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/jenness-v-fortson?page=442">403 U.S. 431, 442</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/jenness-v-fortson?page=442"></a> (1971); <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Rhodes</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/williams-v-rhodes?page=31">393 U.S., at 31-33</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/williams-v-rhodes?page=31"></a>. Congress' interest in not funding hopeless candidacies with large sums of public money, S. Rep. No. 93-689, <i>supra</i>, at 7, necessarily justifies the withholding of public assistance from candidates without significant public support. Thus, Congress may legitimately require "some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support," <i>Jenness</i> v. <i>Fortson, supra</i>, at 442, as an eligibility requirement for public funds. This requirement also serves the important public interest against providing artificial incentives to "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism." <i>Storer</i> v. <i>Brown, supra</i>, at 736; S.

Moreover, expenditure limits for major parties and candidates may well improve the chances of nonmajor parties and their candidates to receive funds and increase their spending. Any risk of harm to minority interests is speculative due to our present lack of knowledge of the practical effects of public financing and cannot overcome the force of the governmental interests against use of public money to foster frivolous candidacies, create a system of splintered parties, and encourage unrestrained factionalism. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants' reliance on the alternative-means analyses of the ballot-access cases generally fails to recognize a significant distinction from the instant case. The primary goal of all candidates is to carry on a successful campaign by communicating to the voters persuasive reasons for electing them. In some of the ballot-access cases the States afforded candidates alternative means for qualifying for the ballot, a step in any campaign that, with rare exceptions, is essential to successful effort. Chapter 95 concededly provides only one method of obtaining pre-election financing; such funding is, however, not as necessary as being on the ballot. See n. 128, <i>supra</i>. Plainly, campaigns can be successfully carried out by means other than public financing; they have been up to this date, and this avenue is still open to all candidates. And, after all, the important achievements of minority <span class="page_number" data-page="102">*102</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="102">102</span> political groups in furthering the development of American democracy<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2582240-fn137">137 </a></sup> were accomplished without the help of public funds. Thus, the limited participation or nonparticipation of nonmajor parties or candidates in public funding does not unconstitutionally disadvantage them. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">137.</div><p id="idp2582240-fn137" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 102 <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Rhodes</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/williams-v-rhodes?page=31">393 U.S. 23, 31-32</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/williams-v-rhodes?page=31"></a> (1968); <i>Sweezy</i> v. <i>New Hampshire</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/sweezy-v-new-hampshire?page=250">354 U.S. 234, 250-251</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/sweezy-v-new-hampshire?page=250"></a> (1957) (plurality opinion).

Appellants contend, however, that the benefit of any such participation is illusory due to § 9004(c), which bars the use of the money for any purpose other than paying campaign expenses or repaying loans that had been used to defray such expenses. The only meaningful use for post-election funds is thus to repay loans; but loans, except from national banks, are "contributions" subject to the general limitations on contributions,18 U.S.C. § 591 (e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). Further, they argue, loans are not readily available to nonmajor parties or candidates before elections to finance their campaigns. Availability of post-election funds therefore assertedly gives them nothing. But in the nature of things the willingness of lenders to make loans will depend upon the pre-election probability that the candidate and his party will attract 5% or more of the voters. When a reasonable prospect of such support appears, the party and candidate may be an acceptable loan risk since the prospect of post-election participation in public funding will be good.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2585296-fn138">138 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="103">*103</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="103">103</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">138.</div><p id="idp2585296-fn138" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 102 Apart from the adjustment for inflation, and assuming a major-party entitlement of $20,000,000, a candidate getting 5% of the popular vote, when the balance is divided between two major parties, would be entitled to a post-election payment of more than $2,100,000 if that sum remains after priority allocations from the fund.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> Finally, appellants challenge the validity of the 5% threshold requirement for general election funding. They argue that, since most state regulations governing ballot access have threshold requirements well below 5%, and because in their view the 5% requirement here is actually stricter than that upheld in <i>Jenness</i> v. <i>Fortson</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/jenness-v-fortson">403 U.S. 431</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/jenness-v-fortson"></a> (1971),<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2587664-fn139">139 </a></sup> the requirement is unreasonable. We have already concluded that the restriction under Chapter 95 is generally less burdensome than ballot-access regulations. <i>Supra</i>, at 94-95. Further, the Georgia provision sustained in <i>Jenness</i> required the candidate to obtain the signatures of 5% of all eligible voters, without regard to party. To be sure, the public funding formula does not permit anyone who voted for another party in the last election to be part of a candidate's 5%. But under Chapter 95 a Presidential candidate needs only 5% or more of the actual vote, not the larger universe of eligible voters. As a result, we cannot say that Chapter 95 is numerically more, or less, restrictive than the regulation in <i>Jenness</i>. In any event, the choice of the percentage requirement that best accommodates the competing interests involved was for Congress to make. See <i>Louisville Gas Co</i>. v. <i>Coleman</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/louisville-gas-electric-co-v-coleman?page=41">277 U.S. 32, 41</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/louisville-gas-electric-co-v-coleman?page=41"></a> (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting); n. 111, <i>supra</i>.

Nominating Convention Financing </p> <p class="paragraph"> The foregoing analysis and reasoning sustaining general election funding apply in large part to convention funding under Chapter 95 and suffice to support our rejection of appellants' challenge to these provisions. Funding of party conventions has increasingly been derived from large private contributions, see H.R. Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 14 (1974), and the governmental interest in eliminating this reliance is as vital as in the case of private contributions to individual candidates. The expenditure limitations on major parties participating in public financing enhance the ability of nonmajor parties to increase their spending relative to the major parties; further, in soliciting private contributions to finance conventions, parties are not subject to the $1,000 contribution limit pertaining to candidates.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2594592-fn141">141 </a></sup> We therefore conclude that appellants' constitutional challenge to the <span class="page_number" data-page="105">*105</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="105">105</span> provisions for funding nominating conventions must also be rejected. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">141.</div><p id="idp2594592-fn141" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 104 As with primary campaigns, Congress could reasonably determine that there was no need for reforms as to minor-party conventions. See <i>infra</i>, at 105-106. This contribution limit applies to "contributions to any candidate," 18 U.S.C. § 608 (b)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), and thus would not govern gifts to a party for general purposes, such as convention funding. Although "contributions to a named candidate made to any political committee" are within § 608(b)(1) if the committee is authorized in writing by a candidate to accept contributions, § 608(b)(4)(A), contributions to a party not for the benefit of any specific candidate would apparently not be subject to the $1,000 ceiling. Moreover, § 608(b)(4)(A) governs only party organizations authorized by a candidate in writing to accept contributions.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> 3. Primary Election Campaign Financing </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants' final challenge is to the constitutionality of Chapter 96, which provides funding of primary campaigns. They contend that these provisions are constitutionally invalid (1) because they do not provide funds for candidates not running in party primaries<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2596384-fn142">142 </a></sup> and (2) because the eligibility formula actually increases the influence of money on the electoral process. In not providing assistance to candidates who do not enter party primaries, Congress has merely chosen to limit at this time the reach of the reforms encompassed in Chapter 96. This Congress could do without constituting the reforms a constitutionally invidious discrimination. The governing principle was stated in <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/katzenbach-v-morgan?page=657">384 U.S. 641,657</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/katzenbach-v-morgan?page=657"></a> (1966): </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">142.</div><p id="idp2596384-fn142" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 105 With respect to the denial of funds to candidates who may not be affiliated with a "political party" for the purposes of public financing, see n. 118, <i>supra</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[I]n deciding the constitutional propriety of the limitations in such a reform measure we are guided by the familiar principles that a `statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did,' <i>Roschen</i> v. <i>Ward</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/roschen-v-ward?page=339">279 U.S. 337, 339</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/roschen-v-ward?page=339"></a>, that a legislature need not `strike at all evils at the same time,' <i>Semler</i> v. <i>Dental Examiners</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/semler-v-dental-examiners?page=610">294 U.S. 608, 610</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/semler-v-dental-examiners?page=610"></a>, and that `reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind,' <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-oklahoma-lee-optical-of-oklahoma-v-williamson?page=489">348 U.S. 483, 489</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-oklahoma-lee-optical-of-oklahoma-v-williamson?page=489"></a>."<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2604016-fn143">143 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">143.</div><p id="idp2604016-fn143" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 105 Appellants argue that this reasoning from <i>Katzenbach</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>, is inapplicable to this case involving First Amendment guarantees.

Counting only the first $250 of each contribution for eligibility purposes requires candidates to solicit smaller contributions from numerous people. Requiring the money to come from citizens of a minimum number of States eliminates candidates whose appeal is limited geographically; a President is elected not by popular vote, but by winning the popular vote in enough States to have a majority in the Electoral College.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2606464-fn144">144 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="107">*107</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="107">107</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">144.</div><p id="idp2606464-fn144" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 106 Appellants contend that the 20-state requirement directly conflicts with <i>Moore</i> v. <i>Ogilvie</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/moore-v-ogilvie">394 U.S. 814</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/moore-v-ogilvie"></a> (1969), but that case is distinguishable. Only 7% of the Illinois voters could have blocked a candidate from qualifying for the ballot, even though the statewide elections were decided by straight majority vote. The clear purpose was to keep any person from being nominated without support in downstate counties making up only 7% of the vote, but those same voters could not come close to defeating a candidate in the general election. There is no similar restriction here on the opportunity to vote for any candidate, and the 20-state requirement is not an <span class="page_number" data-page="107">*107</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="107">107</span> unreasonable method of measuring a candidate's breadth of support.

Taxpayers are entitled to a deduction from ordinary income for political contributions up to $100, or $200 on a joint return. § 218. Appellants note that a married couple in the 70% tax bracket could give $500 to a candidate and claim the full deduction allowed by § 218, thus reducing their tax liability by $140. The matching funds increase the effective contribution to $1,000, and the total cost to the contributors is $360. But the appellants have disregarded a myriad of other possibilities. For example, taxpayers also have the option of claiming a tax credit up to $25, or $50 on a joint return, for one-half of their political contributions. § 41. Any married couple could give $100 to a candidate, claim the full $50 credit, and matching thus allows a contribution of $200 at a cost of only $50 to the contributors. Because this example and others involve greater subsidization — 75% against 64% — of smaller contributions than is involved in appellants' hypothesis, one cannot say that the matching formula unfairly favors wealthy interests or large contributors. Moreover, the effect noted by appellants diminishes as the size of individual contributions approaches $1,000. <br> Finally, these examples clearly reveal that §§ 41 and 218 afford public subsidies for candidates, but appellants have raised no constitutional challenge to the provisions, either on First orFifth Amendment grounds.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> For the reasons stated, we reject appellants' claims that Subtitle H is facially unconstitutional.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2609664-fn147">147 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">147.</div><p id="idp2609664-fn147" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 108 Our responses to the certified constitutional questions pertaining to public financing of Presidential election campaigns are: <br> 5. Does any statutory provision for the public financing of political conventions or campaigns for nomination or election to the Presidency or Vice Presidency violate the rights of one or more of the plaintiffs under the First or Ninth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, or Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, of the Constitution of the United States? <br> Answer: NO. <br> 6. Do the particular provisions of Subtitle H and § 6096 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 deprive one or more of the plaintiffs of such rights under the First or Ninth Amendment or Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, in that they provide federal tax money to support certain political candidates, parties, movements, and organizations or in the manner that they so provide such federal tax money? <br> Answer: NO.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> C.

There is, of course, a relationship between the spending limits in § 608(c) and the public financing provisions; the expenditure limits accepted by a candidate to be eligible for public funding are identical to the limits in § 608(c). But we have no difficulty in concluding that Subtitle H is severable. "Unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law." <i>Champlin</i> <span class="page_number" data-page="109">*109</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="109">109</span> <i>Refining Co</i>. v. <i>Corporation Commission</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/champlin-rfg-co-v-commission?page=234">286 U.S. 210,234</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/champlin-rfg-co-v-commission?page=234"></a> (1932).

In no respect do the foregoing civil actions require the concurrence of or participation by the Attorney General; conversely, the decision not to seek judicial relief in the above respects would appear to rest solely with the Commission.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2626848-fn153">153 </a></sup> With respect to the <span class="page_number" data-page="112">*112</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="112">112</span> referenced Title 18 sections, § 437g (a)(7) provides that if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing before it, the Commission finds an actual or threatened criminal violation, the Attorney General "upon request by the Commission . . . shall institute a civil action for relief." Finally, as "[a]dditional enforcement authority," § 456(a) authorizes the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to make "a finding that a person . . . while a candidate for Federal office, failed to file" a required report of contributions or expenditures.

The Commission shall conduct a hearing at that person's request. § 437g (a)(4). If after its investigation the Commission "determines . . . that there is reason to believe" that a "violation of this Act," <i>i. e.</i>, a civil violation, has occurred or is about to occur, it "may endeavor to correct such violation by informal methods," failing which, the Commission "may institute a civil action for relief." § 437g (a)(5).

While it is clear that the Commission has a duty to refer apparent criminal violations either upon their initial receipt or after an investigation, it would appear at the very least that the Commission, which has "primary jurisdiction" with respect to civil enforcement, § 437c (b), has the sole discretionary power "to determine" whether or not a civil violation has occurred or is about to occur, and consequently whether or not informal or judicial remedies will be pursued.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">154.</div><p id="idp2629024-fn154" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 113 Such a finding is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 <i>et seq</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> The body in which this authority is reposed consists of eight members.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2629744-fn155">155 </a></sup> The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives are <i>ex officio</i> members of the Commission without the right to vote.

Because of the Court of Appeals' emphasis on lack of "ripeness" of the issue relating to the method of appointment of the members of the Commission, we find it necessary to focus particularly on that consideration in this section of our opinion. </p> <p class="paragraph"> We have recently recognized the distinction between jurisdictional limitations imposed by Art.

We likewise observed in the <i>Reorganization Act Cases:</i> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Thus, occurrence of the conveyance allegedly violative of Fifth Amendment rights is in no way hypothetical or speculative.

Its basic holding, in answer to question 8(a), was that "Congress has the constitutional authority to establish and appoint [the Commission] to carry out appropriate legislative functions." 171 U.S. App. D.C., at 244<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3705280-fn"> </a></sup>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=890">519 F.2d, at 890</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=890"></a>. Appellants' claim, embodied in questions 8(b) through 8(f), that the Commission's powers go well beyond "legislative functions" and are facially invalid was in an overarching sense not ripe, since "[w]hether particular powers are predominantly executive or judicial, or insufficiently related to the exercise of appropriate legislative power is an abstract question . . . better decided in the context of a particular factual controversy." <i>Id.</i>, at 243, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=892">519 F.2d, at 892</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=892"></a>. While some of the statutory grants such as civil enforcement and candidate disqualification powers (questions 8(c) and 8(e)) raised, in the court's view, "very serious constitutional questions," only the power of the Commission to issue advisory opinions under § 437f (a) was ripe in the context of an attack on Congress' method of appointment. Even then, beyond the Commission's power to inform the public of its interpretations, the question whether Congress under § 437f (b) could validly give substantive <i>effect</i> to the Commission's opinions in later civil and criminal enforcement proceedings should, the Court of Appeals held, await a case in which a defense based on § 437f (b) was asserted. Finally, the question of the Commission's power under 26 U.S.C. § 9008 (d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) to authorize nominating convention expenditures in excess of the statutory limits (question 8(f)) was found ripe because appellants had not challenged it in relation to the method of appointment but had asserted only that 26 U.S.C. § 9008 (d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) vested excessive discretion in the Commission. The Court of Appeals found that Congress had provided sufficient guidelines to withstand that attack. <br> The Court of Appeals accordingly answered the six certified questions as follows: <br> "8. Do the provisions in the challenged statutes concerning the powers and method of appointment of the Federal Election Commission <span class="page_number" data-page="116">*116</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="116">116</span> violate the rights of one or more of the plaintiffs under the constitutional separation of powers, the First, Fourth, Fifth,Sixth, or Ninth Amendment, Article I, Section 2, Clause 6, Article I, Section 5, Clause 1, or Article III? <br> "(a) Does 2 U.S.C. § 437c (a) violate such rights by the method of appointment of the Federal Election Commission? . . . <br> "Answer: NO <br> "(b) Do 2 U.S.C. § 437d and 437g violate such rights, in that they entrust administration and enforcement of the FECA to the Federal Election Commission? . . . <br> "Answer: NO as to the power to issue advisory opinions; UNRIPE as to all else. <br> "(c) Does 2 U.S.C. § 437g (a) violate such rights, in that it empowers the Federal Election Commission and the Attorney General to bring civil actions (including proceedings for injunctions) against any person who has engaged or who may engage in acts or practices which violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, <i>as amended</i>, or §§ 608, 610, 611, 613, 614, 615, 616, or 617 of Title 18? . . . <br> "Answer: UNRIPE FOR RESOLUTION <br> "(d) Does 2 U.S.C. § 438 (c) violate such rights, in that it empowers the Federal Election Commission to make rules under the FECA in the manner specified therein? . . . <br> "Answer: UNRIPE FOR RESOLUTION <br> "(e) Does 2 U.S.C. § 456 violate such rights, in that it imposes a temporary disqualification on any candidate for election to federal office who is found by the Federal Election Commission to have failed to file a report required by Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act, <i>as amended?</i> . . . <br> "Answer: UNRIPE FOR RESOLUTION <br> "(f) Does § 9008 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 violate such rights, in that it empowers the Federal Election Commission to authorize expenditures of the national committee of a party with respect to presidential nominating conventions in excess of the limits enumerated therein? . . . <br> "Answer: NO"</p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">.</div><p id="idp3705280-fn" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> ERRATA: "244" should be "241".</p> </div> </div> <p class="paragraph"> Since the entry of judgment by the Court of Appeals, <span class="page_number" data-page="116">*116</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="116">116</span> the Commission has undertaken to issue rules and regulations under the authority of § 438(a) (10).

Congress was understandably most concerned with obtaining a final adjudication of as many issues as possible litigated pursuant to the provisions of § 437h. Thus, in order to decide the basic question whether the Act's provision for appointment of the members of the Commission violates the Constitution, we believe we are warranted in considering all of those aspects of the Commission's authority which have been presented by the certified questions.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2644080-fn158">158 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">158.</div><p id="idp2644080-fn158" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 117 With respect to the Commission's power under 26 U.S.C. § 9008 (d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) to authorize excessive convention expenditures (question 8(f)), the fact that appellants in the Court of Appeals may have focused their attack primarily or even exclusively upon the asserted lack of standards attendant to that power, see n. 157, <i>supra</i>, does not foreclose them from challenging that power in relation to Congress' method of appointment of the Commission's members. Question 8(f) asks whether vesting the Commission with this power under 26 U.S.C. § 9008 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) violates "such rights," which by reference to question 8 includes "the rights of [appellants] under the constitutional separation of powers." Since the certified questions themselves provide our jurisdictional framework, § 437h (b), the separation-of-powers aspect of appellants' attack on 26 U.S.C. § 9008 (d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) is properly before this Court.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> Party litigants with sufficient concrete interests at stake may have standing to raise constitutional questions of separation of powers with respect to an agency designated to adjudicate their rights. <i>Palmore</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/palmore-v-united-states">411 U.S. 389</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/palmore-v-united-states"></a> (1973); <i>Glidden Co</i>. v. <i>Zdanok</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/glidden-company-v-zdanok">370 U.S. 530</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/glidden-company-v-zdanok"></a> (1962); <i>Coleman</i> v. <i>Miller</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/coleman-v-miller-3">307 U.S. 433</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/coleman-v-miller-3"></a> (1939). In <i>Glidden</i>, of course, the challenged adjudication had already taken place, whereas in this case appellants' claim is of impending future rulings and determinations by the Commission. But this is a question of ripeness, rather than lack of case or controversy under Art. III, and for the reasons to which we have previously <span class="page_number" data-page="118">*118</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="118">118</span> adverted we hold that appellants' claims as they bear upon the method of appointment of the Commission's members may be presently adjudicated. </p> <p class="paragraph"> B. The Merits </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants urge that since Congress has given the Commission wide-ranging rulemaking and enforcement powers with respect to the substantive provisions of the Act, Congress is precluded under the principle of separation of powers from vesting in itself the authority to appoint those who will exercise such authority. Their argument is based on the language of Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which provides in pertinent part as follows: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellants' argument is that this provision is the exclusive method by which those charged with executing the laws of the United States may be chosen. Congress, they assert, cannot have it both ways. If the Legislature wishes the Commission to exercise all of the conferred powers, then its members are in fact "Officers of the United States" and must be appointed under the Appointments Clause. But if Congress insists upon retaining the power to appoint, then the members of the Commission may not discharge those many functions of the Commission which can be performed only by "Officers of <span class="page_number" data-page="119">*119</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="119">119</span> the United States," as that term must be construed within the doctrine of separation of powers. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellee Commission and <i>amici</i> in support of the Commission urge that the Framers of the Constitution, while mindful of the need for checks and balances among the three branches of the National Government, had no intention of denying to the Legislative Branch authority to appoint its own officers. Congress, either under the Appointments Clause or under its grants of substantive legislative authority and the Necessary and Proper Clause in Art. I, is in their view empowered to provide for the appointment to the Commission in the manner which it did because the Commission is performing "appropriate legislative functions." </p> <p class="paragraph"> The majority of the Court of Appeals recognized the importance of the doctrine of separation of powers which is at the heart of our Constitution, and also recognized the principle enunciated in <i>Springer</i> v. <i>Philippine Islands</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/springer-v-philippine-islands">277 U.S. 189</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/springer-v-philippine-islands"></a> (1928), that the Legislative Branch may not exercise executive authority by retaining the power to appoint those who will execute its laws. But it described appellants' argument based upon Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, as "strikingly syllogistic," and concluded that Congress had sufficient authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I of the Constitution not only to establish the Commission but to appoint the Commission's members. As we have earlier noted, it upheld the constitutional validity of congressional vesting of certain authority in the Commission, and concluded that the question of the constitutional validity of the vesting of its remaining functions was not yet ripe for review. The three dissenting judges in the Court of Appeals concluded that the method of appointment for the Commission did violate the doctrine of separation of powers. <span class="page_number" data-page="120">*120</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="120">120</span> </p> <p class="paragraph"> 1. Separation of Powers </p> <p class="paragraph"> We do not think appellants' arguments based upon Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution may be so easily dismissed as did the majority of the Court of Appeals. Our inquiry of necessity touches upon the fundamental principles of the Government established by the Framers of the Constitution, and all litigants and all of the courts which have addressed themselves to the matter start on common ground in the recognition of the intent of the Framers that the powers of the three great branches of the National Government be largely separate from one another. </p> <p class="paragraph"> James Madison, writing in the Federalist No. 47,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2659488-fn159">159 </a></sup> defended the work of the Framers against the charge that these three governmental powers were not <i>entirely</i> separate from one another in the proposed Constitution. He asserted that while there was some admixture, the Constitution was nonetheless true to Montesquieu's well-known maxim that the legislative, executive, and judicial departments ought to be separate and distinct: </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">159.</div><p id="idp2659488-fn159" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 120 The Federalist No. 47, p. 299 (G.

Again: `Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for <i>the judge</i> would then be <i>the legislator</i>. Were it joined to the executive power, <i>the judge</i> might behave with all the violence of <i>an oppressor</i>.' Some of these reasons <span class="page_number" data-page="121">*121</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="121">121</span> are more fully explained in other passages; but briefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author."<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2665152-fn160">160 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">160.</div><p id="idp2665152-fn160" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 121 <i>Id.</i>, at 302-303 (emphasis in original).</p> </div></blockquote></p>   <p class="paragraph"> Yet it is also clear from the provisions of the Constitution itself, and from the Federalist Papers, that the Constitution by no means contemplates total separation of each of these three essential branches of Government. The President is a participant in the lawmaking process by virtue of his authority to veto bills enacted by Congress. The Senate is a participant in the appointive process by virtue of its authority to refuse to confirm persons nominated to office by the President. The men who met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 were practical statesmen, experienced in politics, who viewed the principle of separation of powers as a vital check against tyranny. But they likewise saw that a hermetic sealing off of the three branches of Government from one another would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of governing itself effectively. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Mr. Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court in <i>Hampton Co</i>. v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/hampton-co-v-united-states">276 U.S. 394</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/hampton-co-v-united-states"></a> (1928), after stating the general principle of separation of powers found in the United States Constitution, went on to observe: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[T]he rule is that in the actual administration of the government Congress or the Legislature should exercise the legislative power, the President or the State executive, the Governor, the executive power, and the Courts or the judiciary the judicial power, and in carrying out that constitutional division into three branches it is a breach of the National fundamental law if Congress gives up its legislative power <span class="page_number" data-page="122">*122</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="122">122</span> and transfers it to the President, or to the Judicial branch, or if by law it attempts to invest itself or its members with either executive power or judicial power. This is not to say that the three branches are not co-ordinate parts of one government and that each in the field of its duties may not invoke the action of the two other branches in so far as the action invoked shall not be an assumption of the constitutional field of action of another branch. In determining what it may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordination." <i>Id.</i>, at 406.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> More recently, Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in the opinion and the judgment of the Court in <i>Youngstown Sheet Tube Co</i>. v. <i>Sawyer</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/youngstown-co-v-sawyer?page=635">343 U.S. 579, 635</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/youngstown-co-v-sawyer?page=635"></a> (1952), succinctly characterized this understanding: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government. It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity."</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Framers regarded the checks and balances that they had built into the tripartite Federal Government as a self-executing safeguard against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other. As Madison put it in Federalist No. 51: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public.

The Appointments Clause </p> <p class="paragraph"> The principle of separation of powers was not simply an abstract generalization in the minds of the Framers: it was woven into the document that they drafted in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787. Article I, § 1, declares: "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States." Article II, § 1, vests the executive power "in a President of the United States of America," and Art. III, § 1, declares that "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." The further concern of the Framers of the Constitution with maintenance of the separation of powers is found in the so-called "Ineligibility" and "Incompatibility" Clauses contained in Art. I, § 6: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> It is in the context of these cognate provisions of the document that we must examine the language of Art. II. § 2, cl. 2, which appellants contend provides the only authorization for appointment of those to whom substantial executive or administrative authority is given <span class="page_number" data-page="125">*125</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="125">125</span> by statute. Because of the importance of its language, we again set out the provision: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Appointments Clause could, of course, be read as merely dealing with etiquette or protocol in describing "Officers of the United States," but the drafters had a less frivolous purpose in mind. This conclusion is supported by language from <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-germaine?page=509">99 U.S. 508, 509-510</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-germaine?page=509"></a> (1879): </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "The Constitution for purposes of appointment very clearly divides all its officers into two classes. The primary class requires a nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. But foreseeing that when offices became numerous, and sudden removals necessary, this mode might be inconvenient, it was provided that, in regard to officers inferior to those specially mentioned, Congress might by law vest their appointment in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. <i>That all persons who can be said to hold an office</i> <i>under the government about to be established under</i> <i>the Constitution were intended to be included within</i> <i>one or the other of these modes of appointment</i> <i>there can be but little doubt</i>." (Emphasis supplied.)</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> We think that the term "Officers of the United States" <span class="page_number" data-page="126">*126</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="126">126</span> as used in Art. II, defined to include "all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government" in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine, supra</i>, is a term intended to have substantive meaning. We think its fair import is that any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States is an "Officer of the United States," and must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by § 2, cl. 2, of that Article. </p> <p class="paragraph"> If "all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government about to be established under the Constitution were intended to be included within one or the other of these modes of appointment," <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine, supra</i>, it is difficult to see how the members of the Commission may escape inclusion. If a postmaster first class, <i>Myers</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/myers-v-united-states-25">272 U.S. 52</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/myers-v-united-states-25"></a> (1926), and the clerk of a district court, <i>Ex parte Hennen</i>, <span class="unlinked-ref">13 Pet. 230</span> (1839), are inferior officers of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, as they are, surely the Commissioners before us are at the very least such "inferior Officers" within the meaning of that Clause.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2698992-fn162">162 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">162.</div><p id="idp2698992-fn162" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 126 <i>"Officers of the United States"</i> does not include all employees of the United States, but there is no claim made that the Commissioners are employees of the United States rather than officers.

The remaining four voting members of the Commission are appointed by the President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate and by the Speaker of the House. While the second part of the Clause <span class="page_number" data-page="127">*127</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="127">127</span> authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of the officers described in that part in "the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments," neither the Speaker of the House nor the President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate comes within this language. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The phrase "Heads of Departments," used as it is in conjunction with the phrase "Courts of Law," suggests that the Departments referred to are themselves in the Executive Branch or at least have some connection with that branch. While the Clause expressly authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of certain officers in the "Courts of Law," the absence of similar language to include Congress must mean that neither Congress nor its officers were included within the language "Heads of Departments" in this part of cl. 2. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Thus with respect to four of the six voting members of the Commission, neither the President, the head of any department, nor the Judiciary has any voice in their selection. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Appointments Clause specifies the method of appointment only for "Officers of the United States" whose appointment is not "otherwise provided for" in the Constitution. But there is no provision of the Constitution remotely providing any alternative means for the selection of the members of the Commission or for anybody like them. Appellee Commission has argued, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the Appointments Clause of Art. II should not be read to exclude the "inherent power of Congress" to appoint its own officers to perform functions necessary to that body as an institution. But there is no need to read the Appointments Clause contrary to its plain language in order to reach the result sought by the Court of Appeals. Article I, § 3, cl. 5, expressly authorizes the selection of the President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate, and § 2, cl. 5, of that Article provides <span class="page_number" data-page="128">*128</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="128">128</span> for the selection of the Speaker of the House.

Contrary to the fears expressed by the majority of the Court of Appeals, nothing in our holding with respect to Art.

X.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2720752-fn173">173 </a></sup> The same Committee also reported a revised article concerning the Legislative Branch to the Convention. The changes are obvious. In the final version, the Senate is shorn of its power to appoint Ambassadors and Judges of the Supreme Court. The President is given, not the power to <i>appoint</i> public officers of the United States, but only the right to <i>nominate</i> them, and a provision is inserted by virtue of which Congress may require Senate confirmation of his nominees. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">173.</div><p id="idp2720752-fn173" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 131 <i>Id.</i>, at 575.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> It would seem a fair surmise that a compromise had been made. But no change was made in the concept of the term "Officers of the United States," which since it had first appeared in Art. X had been taken by all concerned to embrace all appointed officials exercising responsibility under the public laws of the Nation. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellee Commission and <i>amici</i> urge that because of what they conceive to be the extraordinary authority reposed in Congress to regulate elections, this case stands on a different footing than if Congress had exercised its legislative authority in another field. There is, of course, no doubt that Congress has express authority to regulate <span class="page_number" data-page="132">*132</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="132">132</span> congressional elections, by virtue of the power conferred in Art. I, § 4.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2724560-fn174">174 </a></sup> This Court has also held that it has very broad authority to prevent corruption in national Presidential elections. <i>Burroughs</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us">290 U.S. 534</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us"></a> (1934). But Congress has plenary authority in all areas in which it has substantive legislative jurisdiction, <i>M`Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, <span class="unlinked-ref">4 Wheat. 316</span> (1819), so long as the exercise of that authority does not offend some other constitutional restriction. We see no reason to believe that the authority of Congress over federal election practices is of such a wholly different nature from the other grants of authority to Congress that it may be employed in such a manner as to offend well-established constitutional restrictions stemming from the separation of powers. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">174.</div><p id="idp2724560-fn174" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 132 "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators."</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> The position that because Congress has been given explicit and plenary authority to regulate a field of activity, it must therefore have the power to appoint those who are to administer the regulatory statute is both novel and contrary to the language of the Appointments Clause. Unless their selection is elsewhere provided for, <i>all</i> officers of the United States are to be appointed in accordance with the Clause. Principal officers are selected by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Inferior officers Congress may allow to be appointed by the President alone, by the heads of departments, or by the Judiciary. No class or type of officer is excluded because of its special functions. The President appoints judicial as well as executive officers. Neither has it been disputed — and apparently <span class="page_number" data-page="133">*133</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="133">133</span> it is not now disputed — that the Clause controls the appointment of the members of a typical administrative agency even though its functions, as this Court recognized in <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=624">295 U.S. 602, 624</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=624"></a> (1935), may be "predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative" rather than executive. The Court in that case carefully emphasized that although the members of such agencies were to be independent of the Executive in their day-to-day operations, the Executive was not excluded from selecting them. <i>Id.</i>, at 625-626. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellees argue that the legislative authority conferred upon the Congress in Art. I, § 4, to regulate "the Times, places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives" is augmented by the provision in § 5 that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members." Section 5 confers, however, not a general legislative power upon the Congress, but rather a power "judicial in character" upon each House of the Congress. <i>Barry</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Cunningham</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/barry-v-us-ex-rel-cunningham?page=613">279 U.S. 597,613</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/barry-v-us-ex-rel-cunningham?page=613"></a> (1929). The power of each House to judge whether one claiming election as Senator or Representative has met the requisite qualifications, <i>Powell</i> v. <i>McCormack</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/powell-v-cormack">395 U.S. 486</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/powell-v-cormack"></a> (1969), cannot reasonably be translated into a power granted to the Congress itself to impose substantive qualifications on the right to so hold such office. Whatever power Congress may have to legislate, such qualifications must derive from § 4, rather than § 5, of Art. I. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellees also rely on the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution insofar as the authority of the Commission to regulate practices in connection with the Presidential election is concerned. This Amendment provides that certificates of the votes of the electors be "sealed [and] <span class="page_number" data-page="134">*134</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="134">134</span> directed to the President of the Senate," and that the "President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted." The method by which Congress resolved the celebrated disputed Hayes-Tilden election of 1876, reflected in19 Stat. 227, supports the conclusion that Congress viewed this Amendment as conferring upon its two Houses the same sort of power "judicial in character," <i>Barry</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Cunningham, supra</i>, at 613, as was conferred upon each House by Art. I, § 5, with respect to elections of its own members. </p> <p class="paragraph"> We are also told by appellees and <i>amici</i> that Congress had good reason for not vesting in a Commission composed wholly of Presidential appointees the authority to administer the Act, since the administration of the Act would undoubtedly have a bearing on any incumbent President's campaign for re-election. While one cannot dispute the basis for this sentiment as a practical matter, it would seem that those who sought to challenge incumbent Congressmen might have equally good reason to fear a Commission which was unduly responsive to members of Congress whom they were seeking to unseat. But such fears, however rational, do not by themselves warrant a distortion of the Framers' work. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Appellee Commission and <i>amici</i> finally contend, and the majority of the Court of Appeals agreed with them, that whatever shortcomings the provisions for the appointment of members of the Commission might have under Art. II, Congress had ample authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I to effectuate this result. We do not agree. The proper inquiry when considering the Necessary and Proper Clause is not the authority of Congress to create an office or a commission, which is broad indeed, but rather its authority to provide <span class="page_number" data-page="135">*135</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="135">135</span> that its own officers may make appointments to such office or commission. </p> <p class="paragraph"> So framed, the claim that Congress may provide for this manner of appointment under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I stands on no better footing than the claim that it may provide for such manner of appointment because of its substantive authority to regulate federal elections. Congress could not, merely because it concluded that such a measure was "necessary and proper" to the discharge of its substantive legislative authority, pass a bill of attainder or <i>ex post facto</i> law contrary to the prohibitions contained in § 9 of Art. I. No more may it vest in itself, or in its officers, the authority to appoint officers of the United States when the Appointments Clause by clear implication prohibits it from doing so. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The trilogy of cases from this Court dealing with the constitutional authority of Congress to circumscribe the President's power to <i>remove</i> officers of the United States is entirely consistent with this conclusion. In <i>Myers</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/myers-v-united-states-25">272 U.S. 52</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/myers-v-united-states-25"></a> (1926), the Court held that Congress could not by statute divest the President of the power to remove an officer in the Executive Branch whom he was initially authorized to appoint. In explaining its reasoning in that case, the Court said: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "The vesting of the executive power in the President was essentially a grant of the power to execute the laws. But the President alone and unaided could not execute the laws. He must execute them by the assistance of subordinates. . . . As he is charged specifically to take care that they be faithfully executed, the reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that as part of his executive power he should select those who were <span class="page_number" data-page="136">*136</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="136">136</span> to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> . . . . . </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Our conclusion on the merits, sustained by the arguments before stated, is that Article II grants to the President the executive power of the Government, i. e., the general administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment and removal of executive officers — a conclusion confirmed by his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed . . . ." <i>Id.</i>, at 117, 163-164.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> In the later case of <i>Humphrey's Executor</i>, where it was held that Congress could circumscribe the President's power to remove members of independent regulatory agencies, the Court was careful to note that it was dealing with an agency intended to be independent of executive authority " <i>except in its selection</i>."<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=625">295 U.S. at 625</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=625"></a> (emphasis in original). <i>Wiener</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/wiener-v-united-states-2">357 U.S. 349</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/wiener-v-united-states-2"></a> (1958), which applied the holding in <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> to a member of the War Claims Commission, did not question in any respect that members of independent agencies are not independent of the Executive with respect to their appointments. </p> <p class="paragraph"> This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Mr. Justice Sutherland, the author of the Court's opinion in <i>Humphrey's Executor</i>, likewise wrote the opinion for the Court in <i>Springer</i> v. <i>Philippine Islands</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/springer-v-philippine-islands">277 U.S. 189</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/springer-v-philippine-islands"></a> (1928), in which it was said: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Not having the power of appointment, unless expressly granted or incidental to its powers, the legislature cannot engraft executive duties upon a legislative office, since that would be to usurp the power of appointment by indirection; though the case might be different if the additional duties <span class="page_number" data-page="137">*137</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="137">137</span> were devolved upon an appointee of the executive." <i>Id.</i>, at 202.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> 3. The Commission's Powers </p> <p class="paragraph"> Thus, on the assumption that all of the powers granted in the statute may be exercised by an agency whose members <i>have been</i> appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2759760-fn175">175 </a></sup> the ultimate question is which, if any, of those powers may be exercised by the present voting Commissioners, none of whom <i>was</i> appointed as provided by that Clause. Our previous description of the statutory provisions, see <i>supra</i>, at 109-113, disclosed that the Commission's powers fall generally into three categories: functions relating to the flow of necessary information — receipt, dissemination, and investigation; functions with respect to the Commission's task of fleshing out the statute — rulemaking and advisory opinions; and functions necessary to ensure compliance with the statute and rules — informal procedures, administrative determinations and hearings, and civil suits. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">175.</div><p id="idp2759760-fn175" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 137 Since in future legislation that may be enacted in response to today's decision Congress might choose not to confer one or more of the powers under discussion to a properly appointed agency, our assumption is <i>arguendo</i> only. Considerations of ripeness prevent us from deciding, for example, whether such an agency could under § 456 disqualify a candidate for federal election consistently with Art. I, § 5, cl. 1. With respect to this and other powers discussed <i>infra</i>, this page and 138-141, we need pass only upon their nature in relation to the Appointments Clause, and not upon their validity <i>vel non</i>.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> Insofar as the powers confided in the Commission are essentially of an investigative and informative nature, falling in the same general category as those powers which Congress might delegate to one of its own committees, there can be no question that the Commission as presently constituted may exercise them. <i>Kilbourn</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/kilbourn-v-thompson">103 U.S. 168</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/kilbourn-v-thompson"></a> (1881); <i>McGrain</i> v. <i>Daugherty</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/mcgrain-v-daugherty"> <span class="page_number" data-page="138">*138</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="138">138</span>273 U.S. 135</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/mcgrain-v-daugherty"></a> (1927); <i>Eastland</i> v. <i>United States Servicemen's Fund</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/eastland-v-united-states-servicemens-fund">421 U.S. 491</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/eastland-v-united-states-servicemens-fund"></a> (1975). As this Court stated in <i>McGrain, supra</i>, at 175: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information — which not infrequently is true — recourse must be had to others who do possess it. Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that period the power of inquiry — with enforcing process — was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate — indeed, was treated as inhering in it."</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> But when we go beyond this type of authority to the more substantial powers exercised by the Commission, we reach a different result. The Commission's enforcement power, exemplified by its discretionary power to seek judicial relief, is authority that cannot possibly be regarded as merely in aid of the legislative function of Congress. A lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a breach of the law, and it is to the President, and not to the Congress, that the Constitution entrusts the responsibility to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." Art. II, § 3. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Congress may undoubtedly under the Necessary and Proper Clause create "offices" in the generic sense and provide such method of appointment to those "offices" as it chooses. But Congress' power under that Clause <span class="page_number" data-page="139">*139</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="139">139</span> is inevitably bounded by the express language of Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and unless the method it provides comports with the latter, the holders of those offices will not be "Officers of the United States." They may, therefore, properly perform duties only in aid of those functions that Congress may carry out by itself, or in an area sufficiently removed from the administration and enforcement of the public law as to permit their being performed by persons not "Officers of the United States." </p> <p class="paragraph"> This Court observed more than a century ago with respect to litigation conducted in the courts of the United States: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Whether tested, therefore, by the requirements of the Judiciary Act, or by the usage of the government, or by the decisions of this court, it is clear that all such suits, so far as the interests of the United States are concerned, are subject to the direction, and within the control of, the Attorney-General." <i>Confiscation Cases</i>, <span class="unlinked-ref">7 Wall. 454, 458-459</span> (1869).</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court echoed similar sentiments 59 years later in <i>Springer</i> v. <i>Philippine Islands</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/springer-v-philippine-islands?page=202">277 U.S., at 202</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/springer-v-philippine-islands?page=202"></a>, saying: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement. The latter are executive functions. It is unnecessary to enlarge further upon the general subject, since it has so recently received the full consideration of this Court. <i>Myers</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/myers-v-united-states-25">272 U.S. 52</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/myers-v-united-states-25"></a>.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Not having the power of appointment, unless expressly granted or incidental to its powers, the legislature cannot engraft executive duties upon a legislative office, since that would be to usurp the power of appointment by indirection; though the <span class="page_number" data-page="140">*140</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="140">140</span> case might be different if the additional duties were devolved upon an appointee of the executive."</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> We hold that these provisions of the Act, vesting in the Commission primary responsibility for conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating public rights, violate Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution. Such functions may be discharged only by persons who are "Officers of the United States" within the language of that section. </p> <p class="paragraph"> All aspects of the Act are brought within the Commission's broad administrative powers: rulemaking, advisory opinions, and determinations of eligibility for funds and even for federal elective office itself. These functions, exercised free from day-to-day supervision of either Congress<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2779872-fn176">176 </a></sup> or the Executive Branch, are more legislative and judicial in nature than are the Commission's <span class="page_number" data-page="141">*141</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="141">141</span> enforcement powers, and are of kinds usually performed by independent regulatory agencies or by some department in the Executive Branch under the direction of an Act of Congress. Congress viewed these broad powers as essential to effective and impartial administration of the entire substantive framework of the Act. Yet each of these functions also represents the performance of a significant governmental duty exercised pursuant to a public law. While the President may not insist that such functions be delegated to an appointee of his removable at will, <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us">295 U.S. 602</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us"></a> (1935), none of them operates merely in aid of congressional authority to legislate or is sufficiently removed from the administration and enforcement of public law to allow it to be performed by the present Commission. These administrative functions may therefore be exercised only by persons who are "Officers of the United States."<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp2782864-fn177">177 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="142">*142</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="142">142</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">176.</div><p id="idp2779872-fn176" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 140 Before a rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission under § 438(a) (10) may go into effect, it must be transmitted either to the Senate or House of Representatives together with "a detailed explanation and justification of such rule or regulation." § 438(c)(1). If the House of Congress to which the rule is required to be transmitted disapproves the proposed regulation within the specified period of time, it may not be promulgated by the Commission. Appellants make a separate attack on this qualification of the Commission's rulemaking authority, which is but the most recent episode in a long tug of war between the Executive and Legislative Branches of the Federal Government respecting the permissible extent of legislative involvement in rulemaking under statutes which have already been enacted. The history of these episodes is described in Ginnane, The Control of Federal Administration by Congressional Resolutions and Committees, 66 Harv. L.

Does 2 U.S.C. § 437g (a) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) violate such rights, in that it empowers the Federal Election Commission and the Attorney General to bring civil action (including proceedings for injunctions) against any person who has engaged or <span class="page_number" data-page="142">*142</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="142">142</span> who may engage in acts or practices which violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, <i>as amended</i>, or §§ 608, 610, 611, 613, 614, 615, 616, or 617 of Title 18 (1970 ed., Supp. IV)? <br> Question 8(d). Does 2 U.S.C. § 438 (c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) violate such rights in that it empowers the Federal Election Commission to make rules under the FECA in the manner specified therein? <br> Question 8(e). Does 2 U.S.C. § 456 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) violate such rights, in that it imposes a temporary disqualification on any candidate for election to federal office who is found by the Federal Election Commission to have failed to file a report required by Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act, <i>as amended?</i> <br> Question 8(f). Does § 9008 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 violate such rights, in that it empowers the Federal Election Commission to authorize expenditures of the national committee of a party with respect to Presidential nominating conventions in excess of the limits enumerated therein? <br> The Federal Election Commission as presently constituted may not under Art.

The past acts of the Commission are therefore accorded <i>de facto</i> validity, just as we have recognized should be the case with respect to legislative acts performed by legislators held to have been elected in accordance with an unconstitutional apportionment plan. <i>Connor</i> v. <i>Williams</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/connor-v-williams?page=550">404 U.S. 549,550-551</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/connor-v-williams?page=550"></a> (1972).

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in part and dissenting in part. </p> <p class="paragraph"> For reasons set forth more fully later, I dissent from those parts of the Court's holding sustaining the statutory provisions (a) for disclosure of small contributions, (b) for limitations on contributions, and (c) for public financing of Presidential campaigns. In my view, the Act's disclosure scheme is impermissibly broad and violative of the First Amendment as it relates to reporting contributions in excess of $10 and $100. The contribution limitations infringe on First Amendment liberties and suffer from the same infirmities that the Court correctly sees in the expenditure ceilings. The system for public financing of Presidential campaigns is, in my judgment, an impermissible intrusion by the Government into the traditionally private political process. </p> <p class="paragraph"> More broadly, the Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress in this comprehensive scheme of campaign finance. By dissecting the Act bit by bit, and casting off vital parts, the Court fails to recognize that the whole of this Act is greater than the sum of its parts. <span class="page_number" data-page="236">*236</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="236">236</span> Congress intended to regulate all aspects of federal campaign finances, but what remains after today's holding leaves no more than a shadow of what Congress contemplated. I question whether the residue leaves a workable program. </p> <p class="paragraph"> (1) </p> <p class="paragraph"> DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS </p> <p class="paragraph"> Disclosure is, in principle, the salutary and constitutional remedy for most of the ills Congress was seeking to alleviate. I therefore agree fully with the broad proposition that public disclosure of contributions by individuals and by entities — particularly corporations and labor unions — is an effective means of revealing the type of political support that is sometimes coupled with expectations of special favors or rewards. That disclosure impinges on First Amendment rights is conceded by the Court, <i>ante</i>, at 64-66, but given the objectives to which disclosure is directed, I agree that the need for disclosure outweighs individual constitutional claims. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Disclosure is, however, subject to First Amendment limitations which are to be defined by looking to the relevant public interests. The legitimate public interest is the elimination of the appearance and reality of corrupting influences. Serious dangers to the very processes of government justify disclosure of contributions of such dimensions reasonably thought likely to purchase special favors. These fears have been at the root of the Court's prior decisions upholding disclosure requirements, and I therefore have no disagreement, for example, with <i>Burroughs</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us">290 U.S. 534</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us"></a> (1934). </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court's theory, however, goes beyond permissible limits. Under the Court's view, disclosure serves broad informational purposes, enabling the public to be fully informed on matters of acute public interest. Forced disclosure of one aspect of a citizen's political activity, <span class="page_number" data-page="237">*237</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="237">237</span> under this analysis, serves the public right to know. This open-ended approach is the only plausible justification for the otherwise irrationally low ceilings of $10 and $100 for anonymous contributions. The burdens of these low ceilings seem to me obvious, and the Court does not try to question this. With commendable candor, the Court acknowledges: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "It is undoubtedly true that public disclosure of contributions to candidates and political parties will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute." <i>Ante</i>, at 68.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Examples come readily to mind. Rank-and-file union members or rising junior executives may now think twice before making even modest contributions to a candidate who is disfavored by the union or management hierarchy. Similarly, potential contributors may well decline to take the obvious risks entailed in making a reportable contribution to the opponent of a well-entrenched incumbent. This fact of political life did not go unnoticed by the Congress: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "The disclosure provisions really have in fact made it difficult for challengers to challenge incumbents." 120 Cong. Rec. 34392 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Long).</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> See <i>Pollard</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/pollard-v-roberts">283 F. Supp. 248</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/pollard-v-roberts"></a> (ED Ark.), aff'd <i>per curiam</i>, <span class="unlinked-ref">393 U.S. 14</span> (1968). </p> <p class="paragraph"> The public right to know ought not be absolute when its exercise reveals private political convictions. Secrecy, like privacy, is not <i>per se</i> criminal. On the contrary, secrecy and privacy as to political preferences and convictions are fundamental in a free society. For example, one of the great political reforms was the advent of the secret ballot as a universal practice. Similarly, the enlightened labor legislation of our time has enshrined the secrecy of choice of a bargaining representative for <span class="page_number" data-page="238">*238</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="238">238</span> workers. In other contexts, this Court has seen to it that governmental power cannot be used to force a citizen to disclose his private affiliations, <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Button</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/national-association-for-advancement-of-colored-people-v-button">371 U.S. 415</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/national-association-for-advancement-of-colored-people-v-button"></a> (1963), even without a record reflecting any systematic harassment or retaliation, as in <i>Shelton</i> v. <i>Tucker</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/shelton-v-tucker">364 U.S. 479</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/shelton-v-tucker"></a> (1960). For me it is far too late in the day to recognize an ill-defined "public interest" to breach the historic safeguards guaranteed by theFirst Amendment. </p> <p class="paragraph"> We all seem to agree that whatever the legitimate public interest in this area, proper analysis requires us to scrutinize the precise means employed to implement that interest. The balancing test used by the Court requires that fair recognition be given to competing interests. With respect, I suggest the Court has failed to give the traditional standing to some of the First Amendment values at stake here. Specifically, it has failed to confine the particular exercise of governmental power within limits reasonably required. </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "In every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom." <i>Cantwell</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/cantwell-v-state-of-connecticut?page=304">310 U.S. 296, 304</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/cantwell-v-state-of-connecticut?page=304"></a> (1940).</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> "Unduly" must mean not more than necessary, and until today, the Court has recognized this criterion inFirst Amendment cases: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "In the area of First Amendment freedoms, government has the duty to confine itself to <i>the least</i> intrusive regulations which are adequate for the purpose." <i>Lamont</i> v. <i>Postmaster General</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/lamont-v-postmaster-general-of-the-united-states-fixa-v-heilberg?page=310">381 U.S. 301, 310</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/lamont-v-postmaster-general-of-the-united-states-fixa-v-heilberg?page=310"></a> (1965) (BRENNAN, J., concurring). (Emphasis added.)</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Similarly, the Court has said: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[E]ven though the governmental purpose be legitimate <span class="page_number" data-page="239">*239</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="239">239</span> and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved. The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose." <i>Shelton</i> v. <i>Tucker, supra</i>, at 488.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> In light of these views,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3802064-fn1">1 </a></sup> it seems to me that the threshold limits fixed at $10 and $100 for anonymous contributions are constitutionally impermissible on their face. As the Court's opinion notes, <i>ante</i>, at 83, Congress gave little or no thought, one way or the other, to these limits, but rather lifted figures out of a 65-year-old statute.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3803184-fn2">2 </a></sup> As we are all painfully aware, the 1976 dollar is not what it used to be and is surely not the dollar of 1910. Ten dollars in 1976 will, for example, purchase only what $1.68 would buy in 1910. United States Dept. of Labor, Handbook of Labor Statistics 1975, p. 313 (Dec. 1975). To argue that a 1976 contribution of $10 or $100 entails a risk of corruption or its appearance is simply too extravagant to be maintained. No public right to know justifies the compelled disclosure of such contributions, at the risk of discouraging them. There is, in short, no relation whatever between the means used and the legitimate goal of ventilating possible undue influence. Congress has used a shotgun to kill wrens as well as hawks. <span class="page_number" data-page="240">*240</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="240">240</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">1.</div><p id="idp3802064-fn1" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 239 The particular verbalization has varied from case to case.First Amendment analysis defies capture in a single, easy phrase.

The Court's abrupt departure<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3810864-fn3">3 </a></sup> from traditional standards is wrong; surely a greater burden rests on Congress than merely to avoid "irrationality" when regulating in the core area of the First Amendment.

There is no realistic possibility that such modest donations will have a corrupting influence especially on parties that enjoy only "minor" status. Major parties would not notice them; minor parties need them. Furthermore, as the Court candidly recognizes, <i>ante</i>, at 70, minor parties and new parties tend to be sharply ideological in character, and the public can readily discern where such parties stand, without resorting to the indirect device of recording the names of financial supporters. To hold, as the Court has, that privacy must sometimes yield to congressional investigations of alleged subversion, is quite different from making domestic political <span class="page_number" data-page="241">*241</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="241">241</span> partisans give up privacy. Cf. <i>Eastland</i> v. <i>United States Servicemen's Fund</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/eastland-v-united-states-servicemens-fund">421 U.S. 491</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/eastland-v-united-states-servicemens-fund"></a> (1975). In any event, the dangers to First Amendment rights here are too great. Flushing out the names of supporters of minority parties will plainly have a deterrent effect on potential contributors, a consequence readily admitted by the Court, <i>ante</i>, at 71, 83, and supported by the record.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3816304-fn4">4 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">4.</div><p id="idp3816304-fn4" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 241 The record does not show systematic harassment of the sort involved in <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/national-association-for-advancement-of-colored-people-v-state-of-alabama-patterson">357 U.S. 449</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/national-association-for-advancement-of-colored-people-v-state-of-alabama-patterson"></a> (1958). But uncontradicted evidence was adduced with respect to actual experiences of minor parties indicating a sensitivity on the part of potential contributors to the prospect of disclosure. See, <i>e. g.</i>, District Court findings of fact, affidavits of Wertheimer (¶ 6) and Reed (¶ 8), 2B App. 736, 742. This evidence suffices when the governmental interest in putting the spotlight on the sources of support for minor parties or splinter groups is so tenuous.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> I would therefore hold unconstitutional the provisions requiring reporting of contributions of more than $10 and to make a public record of the name, address, and occupation of a contributor of more than $100. </p> <p class="paragraph"> (2) </p> <p class="paragraph"> CONTRIBUTION AND EXPENDITURE LIMITS </p> <p class="paragraph"> I agree fully with that part of the Court's opinion that holds unconstitutional the limitations the Act puts on campaign expenditures which "place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate." <i>Ante</i>, at 58-59. Yet when it approves similarly stringent limitations on contributions, the Court ignores the reasons it finds so persuasive in the context of expenditures. For me contributions and expenditures are two sides of the same First Amendment coin. </p> <p class="paragraph"> By limiting campaign contributions, the Act restricts the amount of money that will be spent on political activity <span class="page_number" data-page="242">*242</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="242">242</span> — and does so directly. Appellees argue, as the Court notes, that these limits will "act as a brake on the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns," <i>ante</i>, at 26. In treating campaign expenditure limitations, the Court says that the "First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise." <i>Ante</i>, at 57. Limiting contributions, as a practical matter, will limit expenditures and will put an effective ceiling on the amount of political activity and debate that the Government will permit to take place. The argument that the ceiling is not, after all, very low as matters now stand gives little comfort for the future, since the Court elsewhere notes the rapid inflation in the cost of political campaigning.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3822320-fn5">5 </a></sup> <i>Ante</i>, at 57. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">5.</div><p id="idp3822320-fn5" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 242 The Court notes that 94.9% of the funds raised by congressional candidates in 1974 came in contributions of less than $1,000, <i>ante</i>, at 26 n. 27, and suggests that the effect of the contribution limitations will be minimal. This logic ignores the disproportionate influence large contributions may have when they are made early in a campaign; "seed money" can be essential, and the inability to obtain it may effectively end some candidacies before they begin. Appellants have excerpted from the record data on nine campaigns to which large, initial contributions were critical. Brief for Appellants 132-138. Campaigns such as these will be much harder, and perhaps impossible, to mount under the Act.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> The Court attempts to separate the two communicative aspects of political contributions — the "moral" support that the gift itself conveys, which the Court suggests is the same whether the gift is $10 or $10,000,<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3823792-fn6">6 </a></sup> and the <span class="page_number" data-page="243">*243</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="243">243</span> fact that money translates into communication. The Court dismisses the effect of the limitations on the second aspect of contributions: "[T]he transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor." <i>Ante</i>, at 21. On this premise — that contribution limitations restrict only the speech of "someone other than the contributor" — rests the Court's justification for treating contributions differently from expenditures.

Seven Senators each spent from $1,000,000 to $1,300,000 in their successful 1974 <span class="page_number" data-page="243">*243</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="243">243</span> election campaigns. A great many congressional candidates spent less than $25,000. 33 Cong. Quarterly 789-790 (1975). The same contribution ceiling would seem to apply to each of these campaigns. Congress accounted for these tremendous variations when it geared the <i>expenditure</i> limits to voting population; but it imposed a flat ceiling on <i>contributions</i> without focusing on the actual evil attacked or the actual harm the restrictions will work.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">7.</div><p id="idp3825936-fn7" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 243 Suppose, for example, that a candidate's committee authorizes a celebrity or elder statesman to make a radio or television address on the candidate's behalf, for which the speaker himself plans to pay. As the Court recognizes, <i>ante</i>, at 24 n. 25, the Act defines this activity as a contribution and subjects it to the $1,000 limit on individual contributions and the $5,000 limit on contributions by political committees — effectively preventing the speech over any substantial radio or television station. Whether the speech is considered an impermissible "contribution" or an allowable "expenditure" turns, not on whether speech by "someone other than the contributor" is involved, but on whether the speech is "authorized" or not. The contribution limitations directly restrict speech by the contributor himself. Of course, this restraint can be avoided if the speaker makes his address without consulting the candidate or his agents. Elsewhere I suggest that the distinction between "independent" and "authorized" political activity is unrealistic and simply cannot be maintained. For present purposes I wish only to emphasize that the Act directly restricts, as a "contribution," what is clearly speech by the "contributor" himself.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">8.</div><p id="idp3826816-fn8" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 244 The Court treats the Act's provisions limiting a candidate's spending from his <i>personal resources</i> as <i>expenditure</i> limits, as indeed the Act characterizes them, and holds them unconstitutional.

I have long thought freedom of association and freedom of expression were two peas from the same pod. The contribution limitations of the Act impose a restriction on certain forms of associational activity that are for the most part, as the Court recognizes, <i>ante</i>, at 29, harmless in fact. And the restrictions are hardly incidental in their effect upon particular campaigns. Judges are ill-equipped to gauge the precise impact of legislation, but a law that impinges upon First Amendment rights requires us to make the attempt. It is not simply speculation to think that the limitations on contributions will foreclose some candidacies.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3830880-fn9">9 </a></sup> The limitations will also alter the nature of some electoral contests drastically.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3831360-fn10">10 </a></sup> <span class="page_number" data-page="245">*245</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="245">245</span> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">9.</div><p id="idp3830880-fn9" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 244 Candidates who must raise large initial contributions in order to appeal for more funds to a broader audience will be handicapped.

If such restraints can be justified at all, they must be justified by the very strongest of state interests. With this much the Court clearly agrees; the Court even goes so far as to note that legislation cutting into these important interests must employ "means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms." <i>Ante</i>, at 25. </p> <p class="paragraph"> After a bow to the "weighty interests" Congress meant to serve, the Court then forsakes this analysis in one sentence: "Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption . . . ." <i>Ante</i>, at 28. In striking down the limitations on campaign expenditures, the Court relies in part on its conclusion that other means — namely, disclosure and contribution ceilings — will adequately serve the statute's aim. It is not clear why the same analysis is not also appropriate in weighing the need for contribution ceilings in addition to disclosure requirements. Congress may well be <span class="page_number" data-page="246">*246</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="246">246</span> entitled to conclude that disclosure was a "partial measure," but I had not thought until today that Congress could enact its conclusions in the First Amendment area into laws immune from the most searching review by this Court. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Finally, it seems clear to me that in approving these limitations on contributions the Court must rest upon the proposition that "pooling" money is fundamentally different from other forms of associational or joint activity. But see <i>ante</i>, at 66. I see only two possible ways in which money differs from volunteer work, endorsements, and the like. Money can be used to buy favors, because an unscrupulous politician can put it to personal use; second, giving money is a less visible form of associational activity. With respect to the first problem, the Act does not attempt to do any more than the bribery laws to combat this sort of corruption. In fact, the Act does not reach at all, and certainly the contribution limits do not reach, forms of "association" that can be fully as corrupt as a contribution intended as a <i>quid pro quo</i> — such as the eleventh-hour endorsement by a former rival, obtained for the promise of a federal appointment. This underinclusiveness is not a constitutional flaw, but it demonstrates that the contribution limits do not clearly focus on this first distinction. To the extent Congress thought that the second problem, the lesser visibility of contributions, required that money be treated differently from other forms of associational activity, disclosure laws are the simple and wholly efficacious answer; they make the invisible apparent. </p> <p class="paragraph"> (3) </p> <p class="paragraph"> PUBLIC FINANCING </p> <p class="paragraph"> I dissent from Part III sustaining the constitutionality of the public financing provisions of Subtitle H. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Since the turn of this century when the idea of Government <span class="page_number" data-page="247">*247</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="247">247</span> subsidies for political campaigns first was broached, there has been no lack of realization that the use of funds from the public treasury to subsidize political activity of private individuals would produce substantial and profound questions about the nature of our democratic society.

No holding of this Court is directly in point, because no federal scheme allocating public funds in a comparable manner has ever been before us. The uniqueness of the plan is not relevant, of course, to whether Congress has power to enact it. Indeed, I do not question the power of Congress to regulate elections; nor do I <span class="page_number" data-page="248">*248</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="248">248</span> challenge the broad proposition that the General Welfare Clause is a grant, not a limitation, of power. <i>M'Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, <span class="unlinked-ref">4 Wheat. 316, 420</span> (1819); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Butler</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/united-states-v-butler-12?page=66">297 U.S. 1, 66</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/united-states-v-butler-12?page=66"></a> (1936). </p> <p class="paragraph"> I would, however, fault the Court for not adequately analyzing and meeting head on the issue whether public financial assistance to the private political activity of individual citizens and parties is a legitimate expenditure of public funds. The public monies at issue here are not being employed simply to police the integrity of the electoral process or to provide a forum for the use of all participants in the political dialogue, as would, for example, be the case if free broadcast time were granted. Rather, we are confronted with the Government's actual financing, out of general revenues, a segment of the political debate itself. As Senator Howard Baker remarked during the debate on this legislation: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "I think there is something politically incestuous about the Government financing and, I believe, inevitably then regulating, the day-to-day procedures by which the Government is selected . . . .</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "I think it is extraordinarily important that the Government not control the machinery by which the public expresses the range of its desires, demands, and dissent." 120 Cong. Rec. 8202 (1974).</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> If this "incest" affected only the issue of the wisdom of the plan, it would be none of the concern of judges. But, in my view, the inappropriateness of subsidizing, from general revenues, the actual political dialogue of the people — the process which begets the Government itself — is as basic to our national tradition as the separation of church and state also deriving from the First Amendment, see <i>Lemon</i> v. <i>Kurtzman</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/lemon-v-kurtzman?page=612">403 U.S. 602, 612</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/lemon-v-kurtzman?page=612"></a> (1971); <i>Walz</i> v. <i>Tax Comm'n</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/walz-v-tax-commission-of-city-of-new-york?page=668">397 U.S. 664, 668-669</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/walz-v-tax-commission-of-city-of-new-york?page=668"></a> (1970), <span class="page_number" data-page="249">*249</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="249">249</span> or the separation of civilian and military authority, see <i>Orloff</i> v. <i>Willoughby</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/orloff-v-willoughby?page=93">345 U.S. 83, 93-94</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/orloff-v-willoughby?page=93"></a> (1953), neither of which is explicit in the Constitution but both of which have developed through case-by-case adjudication of express provisions of the Constitution. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Recent history shows dangerous examples of systems with a close, "incestuous" relationship between "government" and "politics"; the Court's opinion simply dismisses possible dangers by noting that: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Subtitle H is a congressional effort, not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a self-governing people." <i>Ante</i>, at 92-93.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Congress, it reassuringly adds by way of a footnote, has expressed its determination to avoid such a possibility.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3865648-fn15">15 </a></sup> <i>Ante</i>, at 93 n. 126. But the Court points to no basis for predicting that the historical pattern of "varying measures of control and surveillance," <i>Lemon</i> v. <i>Kurtzman, supra</i>, at 621, which usually accompany grants from Government will not also follow in this case.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp3867328-fn16">16 </a></sup> Up to now, the Court has always been extraordinarily sensitive, when dealing with First Amendment rights, to the risk that the "flag tends to follow the dollars."

An obvious underlying basis for this reluctance is that delegate selection and the management of political conventions have been considered a strictly private political matter, not the business of Government inspectors. But once the Government finances these national conventions by the expenditure of millions of dollars from the public treasury, we may be providing a springboard for later attempts to impose a whole range of requirements on delegate selection and convention activities.

There is nothing to assure that the "fund" will actually be adequate for the Act's objectives. Thus, I find it difficult to see a rational basis for concluding that this scheme would, in fact, attain the stated purposes of the Act when its own funding scheme affords no real idea of the amount of the available funding. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">19.</div><p id="idp3876528-fn19" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 250 See generally remarks of Senator Gore, 112 Cong.

But the present system could preclude or severely hamper access to funds before a given election by a group or an individual who might, at the time of the election, reflect the views of a major segment or even a majority of the electorate. The fact that there have been few drastic realignments in our basic two-party structure in 200 years is no constitutional justification for freezing the status quo of the present major parties at the expense of such future political movements. Cf. discussion, <i>ante</i>, at 73. When and if some minority party achieves majority status, Congress can readily deal with any problems that arise. In short, I see grave risks in legislation, enacted by incumbents of the major political parties, which distinctly disadvantages minor parties or independent candidates. This Court has, until today, been particularly cautious when dealing with enactments that tend to perpetuate those who control legislative power. See <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/reynolds-v-sims?page=570">377 U.S. 533, 570</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/reynolds-v-sims?page=570"></a> (1964). </p> <p class="paragraph"> I would also find unconstitutional the system of <span class="page_number" data-page="252">*252</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="252">252</span> matching grants which makes a candidate's ability to amass private funds the sole criterion for eligibility for public funds. Such an arrangement can put at serious disadvantage a candidate with a potentially large, widely diffused — but poor — constituency. The ability of a candidate's supporters to help pay for his campaign cannot be equated with their willingness to cast a ballot for him. See <i>Lubin</i> v. <i>Panish</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/lubin-v-panish">415 U.S. 709</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/lubin-v-panish"></a> (1974); <i>Bullock</i> v. <i>Carter</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/bullock-v-carter">405 U.S. 134</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/bullock-v-carter"></a> (1972). </p> <p class="paragraph"> (4) </p> <p class="paragraph"> I cannot join in the attempt to determine which parts of the Act can survive review here. The statute as it now stands is unworkable and inequitable. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I agree with the Court's holding that the Act's restrictions on expenditures made "relative to a clearly identified candidate," independent of any candidate or his committee, are unconstitutional. <i>Ante</i>, at 39-51. Paradoxically the Court upholds the limitations on individual contributions, which embrace precisely the same sort of expenditures "relative to a clearly identified candidate" if those expenditures are "authorized or requested" by the "candidate or his agents." <i>Ante</i>, at 24 n. 25. The Act as cut back by the Court thus places intolerable pressure on the distinction between "authorized" and "unauthorized" expenditures on behalf of a candidate; even those with the most sanguine hopes for the Act might well concede that the distinction cannot be maintained. As the Senate Report on the bill said: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "Whether campaigns are funded privately or publicly . . . controls are imperative if Congress is to enact meaningful limits on direct contributions. Otherwise, wealthy individuals limited to a $3,000 direct contribution [$1,000 in the bill as finally enacted] could also purchase one hundred thousand <span class="page_number" data-page="253">*253</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="253">253</span> dollars' worth of advertisements for a favored candidate. Such a loophole would render direct contribution limits virtually meaningless." S. Rep. No. 93-689, p. 18 (1974).</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Given the unfortunate record of past attempts to draw distinctions of this kind, see <i>ante</i>, at 61-62, it is not too much to predict that the Court's holding will invite avoidance, if not evasion, of the intent of the Act, with "independent" committees undertaking "unauthorized" activities in order to escape the limits on contributions. The Court's effort to blend First Amendment principles and practical politics has produced a strange offspring. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Moreover, the Act — or so much as the Court leaves standing — creates significant inequities. A candidate with substantial personal resources is now given by the Court a clear advantage over his less affluent opponents, who are constrained by law in fundraising, because the Court holds that the "First Amendment cannot tolerate" any restrictions on spending. <i>Ante</i>, at 59. Minority parties, whose situation is difficult enough under an Act that excludes them from public funding, are prevented from accepting large single-donor contributions. At the same time the Court sustains the provision aimed at broadening the base of political support by requiring candidates to seek a greater number of small contributors, it sustains the unrealistic disclosure thresholds of $10 and $100 that I believe will deter those hoped-for small contributions. Minor parties must now compete for votes against two major parties whose expenditures will be vast. Finally, the Act's distinction between contributions in money and contributions in services remains, with only the former being subject to any limits. As Judge Tamm put it in dissent from the Court of Appeals' opinion: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[T]he classification created only regulates certain <span class="page_number" data-page="254">*254</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="254">254</span> types of disproportional influences. Under section 591(e)(5), services are excluded from contributions. This allows the housewife to volunteer time that might cost well over $1000 to hire on the open market, while limiting her neighbor who works full-time to a regulated contribution. It enhances the disproportional influence of groups who command large quantities of these volunteer services and will continue to magnify this inequity by not allowing for an inflation adjustment to the contribution limit. It leads to the absurd result that a lawyer's contribution of services to aid a candidate in complying with FECA is exempt, but his first amendment activity is regulated if he falls ill and hires a replacement." <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=266">171 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 266</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=266"></a>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=915">519 F.2d 821, 915</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4?page=915"></a> (1975).</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> One need not call problems of this order equal protection violations to recognize that the contribution limitations of the Act create grave inequities that are aggravated by the Court's interpretation of the Act. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court's piecemeal approach fails to give adequate consideration to the integrated nature of this legislation.

The incongruities are obvious. The Commission is now eliminated, yet its very purpose was to guide candidates and campaign workers — and their accountants and lawyers — through an intricate statutory maze where a misstep can lead to imprisonment. All candidates can now spend freely; affluent candidates, after today, can spend their own money without limit; yet, contributions for the ordinary <span class="page_number" data-page="255">*255</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="255">255</span> candidate are severely restricted in amount — and small contributors are deterred.

To limit either contributions or expenditures as to churches would plainly restrict "the free exercise" of religion. In my view Congress can no more ration political expression than it can ration religious expression; and limits on political or religious contributions and expenditures effectively curb expression in both areas.

I dissent from the answers to certified questions 3(a), 3(d), and 4(a). I also join in Part III of the Court's opinion and in much of Parts I-B, II, and IV. </p> <p class="paragraph"> </p> <h3> I</h3> <p class="paragraph"> It is accepted that Congress has power under the Constitution to regulate the election of federal officers, including the President and the Vice President. This includes the authority to protect the elective processes against the "two great natural and historical enemies of all republics, open violence and insidious corruption," <i>Ex parte Yarbrough</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/ex-parte-yarbrough?page=658">110 U.S. 651, 658</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/ex-parte-yarbrough?page=658"></a> (1884); for "[i]f this government is anything more than a mere aggregation of delegated agents of other States and governments, each of which is superior to the general government, it must have the power to protect the elections on which its existence depends from violence and corruption," the latter being the consequence of "the free use of money in elections, arising from the vast growth of recent wealth . . . ." <i>Id.</i>, at 657-658, 667. </p> <p class="paragraph"> This teaching from the last century was quoted at length and reinforced in <i>Burroughs</i> v. <i>United States</i>,<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us?page=546">290 U.S. 534, 546-548</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us?page=546"></a> (1934). In that case the Court sustained the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, Title III of the Act of Feb. 28, 1925, 43 Stat. 1070, which, among other things, required political committees to keep <span class="page_number" data-page="258">*258</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="258">258</span> records and file reports concerning all contributions and expenditures received and made by political committees for the purposes of influencing the election of candidates for federal office. The Court noted the conclusion of Congress that public disclosure of contributions would tend to prevent the corrupt use of money to influence elections; this, together with the requirement "that the treasurer's statement shall include full particulars in respect of expenditures," made it "plain that the statute as a whole is calculated to discourage the making and use of contributions for purposes of corruption."<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us?page=548">290 U.S., at 548</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/burroughs-and-cannon-v-us?page=548"></a>. Congress clearly had the power to further as it did that fundamental goal: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "The power of Congress to protect the election of President and Vice President from corruption being clear, the choice of means to that end presents a question primarily addressed to the judgment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship between the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone." <i>Id.</i>, at 547-548.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Pursuant to this undoubted power of Congress to vindicate the strong public interest in controlling corruption and other undesirable uses of money in connection with election campaigns, the Federal Election Campaign Act substantially broadened the reporting and disclosure requirements that so long have been a part of the federal law. Congress also concluded that limitations on contributions and expenditures were essential if the aims of the Act were to be achieved fully. In another major innovation, aimed at insulating candidates from the time-consuming and entangling task of raising huge sums of <span class="page_number" data-page="259">*259</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="259">259</span> money, provision was made for public financing of political campaigns for federal office. A Federal Election Commission (FEC) was also created to administer the law. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The disclosure requirements and the limitations on contributions and expenditures are challenged as invalid abridgments of the right of free speech protected by theFirst Amendment. I would reject these challenges. I agree with the Court's conclusion and much of its opinion with respect to sustaining the disclosure provisions. I am also in agreement with the Court's judgment upholding the limitations on contributions. I dissent, however, from the Court's view that the expenditure limitations of 18 U.S.C. § 608 (c) and (e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) violate the First Amendment. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Concededly, neither the limitations on contributions nor those on expenditures directly or indirectly purport to control the content of political speech by candidates or by their supporters or detractors. What the Act regulates is giving and spending money, acts that haveFirst Amendment significance not because they are themselves communicative with respect to the qualifications of the candidate, but because money may be used to defray the expenses of speaking or otherwise communicating about the merits or demerits of federal candidates for election. The act of giving money to political candidates, however, may have illegal or other undesirable consequences: it may be used to secure the express or tacit understanding that the giver will enjoy political favor if the candidate is elected. Both Congress and this Court's cases have recognized this as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Since the contribution and expenditure limitations are neutral as to the content of speech and are not motivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech <span class="page_number" data-page="260">*260</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="260">260</span> of particular candidates or of political speech in general, this case depends on whether the nonspeech interests of the Federal Government in regulating the use of money in political campaigns are sufficiently urgent to justify the incidental effects that the limitations visit upon theFirst Amendment interests of candidates and their supporters. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Despite its seeming struggle with the standard by which to judge this case, this is essentially the question the Court asks and answers in the affirmative with respect to the limitations on contributions which individuals and political committees are permitted to make to federal candidates. In the interest of preventing undue influence that large contributors would have or that the public might think they would have, the Court upholds the provision that an individual may not give to a candidate, or spend on his behalf if requested or authorized by the candidate to do so, more than $1,000 in any one election. This limitation is valid although it imposes a low ceiling on what individuals may deem to be their most effective means of supporting or speaking on behalf of the candidate — <i>i. e.</i>, financial support given directly to the candidate. The Court thus accepts the congressional judgment that the evils of unlimited contributions are sufficiently threatening to warrant restriction regardless of the impact of the limits on the contributor's opportunity for effective speech and in turn on the total volume of the candidate's political communications by reason of his inability to accept large sums from those willing to give. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The congressional judgment, which I would also accept, was that other steps must be taken to counter the corrosive effects of money in federal election campaigns. One of these steps is § 608(e), which, aside from those funds that are given to the candidate or spent at his <span class="page_number" data-page="261">*261</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="261">261</span> request or with his approval or cooperation, limits what a contributor may independently spend in support or denigration of one running for federal office. Congress was plainly of the view that these expenditures also have corruptive potential; but the Court strikes down the provision, strangely enough claiming more insight as to what may improperly influence candidates than is possessed by the majority of Congress that passed this bill and the President who signed it. Those supporting the bill undeniably included many seasoned professionals who have been deeply involved in elective processes and who have viewed them at close range over many years. </p> <p class="paragraph"> It would make little sense to me, and apparently made none to Congress, to limit the amounts an individual may give to a candidate or spend with his approval but fail to limit the amounts that could be spent on his behalf. Yet the Court permits the former while striking down the latter limitation. No more than $1,000 may be given to a candidate or spent at his request or with his approval or cooperation; but otherwise, apparently, a contributor is to be constitutionally protected in spending unlimited amounts of money in support of his chosen candidate or candidates. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Let us suppose that each of two brothers spends $1 million on TV spot announcements that he has individually prepared and in which he appears, urging the election of the same named candidate in identical words. One brother has sought and obtained the approval of the candidate; the other has not. The former may validly be prosecuted under § 608(e); under the Court's view, the latter may not, even though the candidate could scarcely help knowing about and appreciating the expensive favor. For constitutional purposes it is difficult to see the difference between the two situations. I would take the word of those who know — that limiting <span class="page_number" data-page="262">*262</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="262">262</span> independent expenditures is essential to prevent transparent and widespread evasion of the contribution limits. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In sustaining the contribution limits, the Court recognizes the importance of avoiding public misapprehension about a candidate's reliance on large contributions. It ignores that consideration in invalidating § 608(e). In like fashion, it says that Congress was entitled to determine that the criminal provisions against bribery and corruption, together with the disclosure provisions, would not in themselves be adequate to combat the evil and that limits on contributions should be provided. Here, the Court rejects the identical kind of judgment made by Congress as to the need for and utility of expenditure limits. I would not do so. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court also rejects Congress' judgment manifested in § 608(c) that the federal interest in limiting total campaign expenditures by individual candidates justifies the incidental effect on their opportunity for effective political speech. I disagree both with the Court's assessment of the impact on speech and with its narrow view of the values the limitations will serve. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Proceeding from the maxim that "money talks," the Court finds that the expenditure limitations will seriously curtail political expression by candidates and interfere substantially with their chances for election. The Court concludes that the Constitution denies Congress the power to limit campaign expenses; federal candidates — and I would suppose state candidates, too — are to have the constitutional right to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in quest of their own election. </p> <p class="paragraph"> As an initial matter, the argument that money is speech and that limiting the flow of money to the speaker violates the First Amendment proves entirely too much. Compulsory bargaining and the right to strike, both provided for or protected by federal law, inevitably have <span class="page_number" data-page="263">*263</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="263">263</span> increased the labor costs of those who publish newspapers, which are in turn an important factor in the recent disappearance of many daily papers. Federal and state taxation directly removes from company coffers large amounts of money that might be spent on larger and better newspapers. The antitrust laws are aimed at preventing monopoly profits and price fixing, which gouge the consumer. It is also true that general price controls have from time to time existed and have been applied to the newspapers or other media. But it has not been suggested, nor could it be successfully, that these laws, and many others, are invalid because they siphon off or prevent the accumulation of large sums that would otherwise be available for communicative activities. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In any event, as it should be unnecessary to point out, money is not always equivalent to or used for speech, even in the context of political campaigns. I accept the reality that communicating with potential voters is the heart of an election campaign and that widespread communication has become very expensive. There are, however, many expensive campaign activities that are not themselves communicative or remotely related to speech. Furthermore, campaigns differ among themselves. Some seem to spend much less money than others and yet communicate as much as or more than those supported by enormous bureaucracies with unlimited financing. The record before us no more supports the conclusion that the communicative efforts of congressional and Presidential candidates will be crippled by the expenditure limitations than it supports the contrary. The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by the Act and that the communicative efforts of these campaigns would not seriously suffer. In this posture <span class="page_number" data-page="264">*264</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="264">264</span> of the case, there is no sound basis for invalidating the expenditure limitations, so long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial, which in my view they are. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In the first place, expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption. The Court upholds the overall limit of $25,000 on an individual's political contributions in a single election year on the ground that it helps reinforce the limits on gifts to a single candidate. By the same token, the expenditure limit imposed on candidates plays its own role in lessening the chance that the contribution ceiling will be violated. Without limits on total expenditures, campaign costs will inevitably and endlessly escalate. Pressure to raise funds will constantly build and with it the temptation to resort in "emergencies" to those sources of large sums, who, history shows, are sufficiently confident of not being caught to risk flouting contribution limits. Congress would save the candidate from this predicament by establishing a reasonable ceiling on all candidates. This is a major consideration in favor of the limitation. It should be added that many successful candidates will also be saved from large, overhanging campaign debts which must be paid off with money raised while holding public office and at a time when they are already preparing or thinking about the next campaign. The danger to the public interest in such situations is self-evident. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Besides backing up the contribution provisions, which are aimed at preventing untoward influence on candidates that are elected, expenditure limits have their own potential for preventing the corruption of federal elections themselves. For many years the law has required the disclosure of expenditures as well as contributions. As <i>Burroughs</i> indicates, the corrupt use of money by candidates <span class="page_number" data-page="265">*265</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="265">265</span> is as much to be feared as the corrosive influence of large contributions. There are many illegal ways of spending money to influence elections. One would be blind to history to deny that unlimited money tempts people to spend it on <i>whatever</i> money can buy to influence an election. On the assumption that financing illegal activities is low on the campaign organization's priority list, the expenditure limits could play a substantial role in preventing unethical practices. There just would not be enough of "that kind of money" to go around. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I have little doubt in addition that limiting the total that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising, and so free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways unconnected with the fundraising function. There is nothing objectionable — indeed it seems to me a weighty interest in favor of the provision — in the attempt to insulate the political expression of federal candidates from the influence inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising increasingly large sums of money. I regret that the Court has returned them all to the treadmill. </p> <p class="paragraph"> It is also important to restore and maintain public confidence in federal elections. It is critical to obviate or dispel the impression that federal elections are purely and simply a function of money, that federal offices are bought and sold or that political races are reserved for those who have the facility — and the stomach — for doing whatever it takes to bring together those interests, groups, and individuals that can raise or contribute large fortunes in order to prevail at the polls. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The ceiling on candidate expenditures represents the considered judgment of Congress that elections are to be decided among candidates none of whom has overpowering advantage by reason of a huge campaign war chest. At least so long as the ceiling placed upon the candidates <span class="page_number" data-page="266">*266</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="266">266</span> is not plainly too low, elections are not to turn on the difference in the amounts of money that candidates have to spend. This seems an acceptable purpose and the means chosen a commonsense way to achieve it. The Court nevertheless holds that a candidate has a constitutional right to spend unlimited amounts of money, mostly that of other people, in order to be elected. The holding perhaps is not that federal candidates have the constitutional right to purchase their election, but many will so interpret the Court's conclusion in this case. I cannot join the Court in this respect. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I also disagree with the Court's judgment that § 608(a), which limits the amount of money that a candidate or his family may spend on his campaign, violates the Constitution. Although it is true that this provision does not promote any interest in preventing the corruption of candidates, the provision does, nevertheless, serve salutary purposes related to the integrity of federal campaigns. By limiting the importance of personal wealth, § 608(a) helps to assure that only individuals with a modicum of support from others will be viable candidates. This in turn would tend to discourage any notion that the outcome of elections is primarily a function of money. Similarly, § 608(a) tends to equalize access to the political arena, encouraging the less wealthy, unable to bankroll their own campaigns, to run for political office. </p> <p class="paragraph"> As with the campaign expenditure limits, Congress was entitled to determine that personal wealth ought to play a less important role in political campaigns than it has in the past. Nothing in the First Amendment stands in the way of that determination. </p> <p class="paragraph"> For these reasons I respectfully dissent from the Court's answers to certified questions 3(a), 3(d), and 4(a). <span class="page_number" data-page="267">*267</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="267">267</span> </p> <h3> II</h3> <p class="paragraph"> I join the answers in Part IV of the Court's opinion, <i>ante</i>, at 141-142, n. 177, to the questions certified by the District Court relating to the composition and powers of the FEC, <i>i. e.</i>, questions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), 8(d) (with the qualifications stated <i>infra</i>, at 282-286), 8(e), and 8(f).

From the "representative examples of [the FEC's] various powers" the Court describes, <i>ante</i>, at 109-113, it is plain that the FEC is the primary agency for the enforcement and administration of major parts of the election laws. It does not replace or control the executive agencies with respect to criminal prosecutions, but within the wide zone of its authority the FEC is independent of executive as well as congressional control except insofar as certain of its regulations must be laid before and not be disapproved by Congress. § 438(c);26 U.S.C. § 9009 (c), 9039(c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).

The matter of the appointment of officers of the new Federal Government was repeatedly debated by the Framers, and the final formulation of the Clause arrived at only after the most careful debate and consideration of its place in the overall design of government. The appointment power was a major building block fitted into the constitutional structure designed to avoid the accumulation or exercise of arbitrary power by the Federal Government. The basic approach was that official power should be divided among the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Departments. The separation-of-powers principle was implemented by a series of provisions, among which was the knowing decision that Congress was to have no power whatsoever to appoint federal officers, except for the power of each House to appoint its own officers serving in the strictly legislative <span class="page_number" data-page="272">*272</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="272">272</span> processes and for the confirming power of the Senate alone. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The decision to give the President the exclusive power to initiate appointments was thoughtful and deliberate. The Framers were attempting to structure three departments of government so that each would have affirmative powers strong enough to resist the encroachment of the others. A fundamental tenet was that the same persons should not both legislate and administer the laws.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4029392-fn9">9 </a></sup> From the very outset, provision was made to prohibit members of Congress from holding office in another branch of the Government while also serving in Congress. There was little if any dispute about this incompatibility provision which survived in Art. I, § 6, of the Constitution as finally ratified.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4030400-fn10">10 </a></sup> Today, no person may serve in Congress and at the same time be Attorney General, Secretary of State, a member of the judiciary, a United States attorney, or a member of the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board. </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">9.</div><p id="idp4029392-fn9" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 272 Watson, Congress Steps Out: A Look at Congressional Control of the Executive, 63 Calif.

II as finally adopted, law enforcement authority was not to be lodged in elected legislative officials subject to political pressures. Neither was the Legislative Branch to have the power to appoint those who were to enforce and administer the law. Also, the appointment power denied Congress and vested in the President was not limited to purely executive officers but reached officers performing purely judicial functions as well as all other officers of the United States. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I thus find singularly unpersuasive the proposition that because the FEC is implementing statutory policies with respect to the conduct of elections, which policies Congress has the power to propound, its members may be appointed by Congress. One might as well argue that the exclusive and plenary power of Congress over interstate commerce authorizes Congress to appoint the members of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of many other regulatory commissions; that its exclusive power to provide for patents and copyrights would permit the administration of the patent laws to be carried out by a congressional committee; or that the exclusive power of the Federal Government to establish post offices authorizes <span class="page_number" data-page="275">*275</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="275">275</span> Congress itself or the Speaker of the House and the President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate to appoint postmasters and to enforce the postal laws. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Congress clearly has the power to create federal offices and to define the powers and duties of those offices, <i>Myers</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/myers-v-united-states-25?page=128">272 U.S. 52, 128-129</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/myers-v-united-states-25?page=128"></a> (1926), but no case in this Court even remotely supports the power of Congress to appoint an officer of the United States aside from those officers each House is authorized by Art. I to appoint to assist in the legislative processes. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In <i>Myers</i>, a postmaster of the first class was removed by the President prior to the expiration of his statutory four-year term. Challenging the President's power to remove him contrary to the statute, he sued for his salary. The challenge was rejected here. The Court said that under the Constitution the power to appoint the principal officers of the Executive Branch was an inherent power of the President: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[T]he reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that as part of his executive power [the President] should select those who were to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws." <i>Id.</i>, at 117.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p class="paragraph"> Further, absent express limitation in the Constitution, the President was to have unrestricted power to remove those administrative officers essential to him in discharging his duties. These fundamental rules were to extend to those bureau and department officers with power to issue regulations and to discharge duties of a quasi-judicial nature — those members of "executive tribunal whose decisions after hearing affect interests of individuals." <i>Id.</i>, at 135. As for inferior officers such as the plaintiff postmaster, the same principles were to govern if Congress chose to place the appointment in the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, as <span class="page_number" data-page="276">*276</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="276">276</span> was the case in <i>Myers</i>. Under the Appointments Clause, Congress could — but did not in the <i>Myers</i> case — permit the appointment of inferior officers by the heads of departments, in which event, the Court said, Congress would have the authority to establish a term of office and limit the reasons for their removal. But in no circumstance could Congress participate in the removal: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <blockquote> <p class="blockquote"> "[T]he Court never has held, nor reasonably could hold, although it is argued to the contrary on behalf of the appellant, that the excepting clause enables Congress to draw to itself, or to either branch of it, the power to remove or the right to participate in the exercise of that power. To do this would be to go beyond the words and implications of that clause and to infringe the constitutional principle of the separation of governmental powers." <i>Id.</i>, at 161.</p> </blockquote> <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us">295 U.S. 602</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us"></a> (1935), limited the reach of the <i>Myers</i> case. There the President attempted to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission prior to the expiration of his statutory term and for reasons not specified in the statute. The Court ruled that the Presidential removal power vindicated in <i>Myers</i> related solely to "purely executive officers,"<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=628">295 U.S., at 628</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=628"></a>, from whom the Court sharply distinguished officers such as the members of the Federal Trade Commission who were to be free from political dominance and control, whose duties are "neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative." <i>Id.</i>, at 624. Contrary to the dicta in <i>Myers</i>, such an officer was thought to occupy "no place in the executive department," to exercise "no part of the executive power vested by the Constitution in the President," <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=628">295 U.S., at 628</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us?page=628"></a>, and to be immune from removal by the President except on terms specified by Congress. The Commissioners were described as being <span class="page_number" data-page="277">*277</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="277">277</span> in part an administrative body carrying out legislative policies and in part an agency of the Judiciary, <i>ibid.;</i> such a body was intended to be "independent of executive authority, <i>except in its selection</i>, and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official or any department of the government." <i>Id.</i>, at 625-626. (Emphasis in original.) </p> <p class="paragraph"> The holding in <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> was confirmed in <i>Wiener</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/wiener-v-united-states-2">357 U.S. 349</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/wiener-v-united-states-2"></a> (1958), but the Court did not question what <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> had expressly recognized — that members of independent agencies are not independent of the Executive with respect to their appointments. Nor did either <i>Wiener</i> or <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> suggest that Congress could not only create the independent agency, specify its duties, and control the grounds for removal of its members but could also <i>itself</i> appoint or remove them without the participation of the Executive Branch of the Government. To have so held would have been contrary to the Appointments Clause as the <i>Myers</i> case recognized. </p> <p class="paragraph"> It is said that historically Congress has used its own officers to receive and file the reports of campaign expenditures and contributions as required by law and that this Court should not interfere with this practice. But the Act before us creates a separate and independent campaign commission with members, some nominated by the President, who have specified terms of office, are not subject to removal by Congress, and are free from congressional control in their day-to-day functions. The FEC, it is true, is the designated authority with which candidates and political committees must file reports of contributions and expenditures, as required by the Act. But the FEC may also make rules and regulations with respect to the disclosure requirements, may investigate reported violations, issue subpoenas, hold its own hearings <span class="page_number" data-page="278">*278</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="278">278</span> and institute civil enforcement proceedings in its own name. Absent a request by the FEC, it would appear that the Attorney General has no role in the civil enforcement of the reporting and disclosure requirements. The FEC may also issue advisory opinions with respect to the legality of any particular activities so as to protect those persons who in good faith have conducted themselves in reliance on the FEC's opinion. These functions go far beyond mere information gathering, and there is no long history of lodging such enforcement powers in congressional appointees. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Nor do the FEC's functions stop with policing the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Act. The FEC is given express power to administer, obtain compliance with, and "to formulate general policy"<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4065248-fn22">22 </a></sup> with respect to 18 U.S.C. § 608-617, so much so that the Act expressly provides that "[t]he Commission has primary jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement of such provisions."<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4066272-fn23">23 </a></sup> Following its own proceedings the FEC may request the Attorney General to bring civil enforcement proceedings, a request which the Attorney General must honor.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4066832-fn24">24 </a></sup> And good-faith conduct taken in accordance <span class="page_number" data-page="279">*279</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="279">279</span> with the FEC's advisory opinions as to whether any transaction or activity would violate any of these criminal provisions "shall be presumed to be in compliance with" these sections.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4067856-fn25">25 </a></sup> § 437f (b). Finally, the FEC has the central role in administering and enforcing the provisions <span class="page_number" data-page="280">*280</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="280">280</span> of Title 26 contemplating the public financing of political campaigns.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4068912-fn26">26 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">22.</div><p id="idp4065248-fn22" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 278 § 437d (a)(9).</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">23.</div><p id="idp4066272-fn23" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 278 § 437c (b).</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">24.</div><p id="idp4066832-fn24" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 278 Section 437g (a)(7) provides: <br> "Whenever in the judgment of the Commission, after affording due notice and an opportunity for a hearing, any person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any [relevant] provision . . . upon request by the Commission the Attorney General on behalf of the United States <i>shall</i> institute a civil action for relief . . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) <br> The FEC argues that "`there is no showing in this case of a convincing legislative history that would enable us to conclude that "shall" was intended to be the "language of command."'" FEC Brief 62 n. 52, quoting <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4">171 U.S.App.D.C. 172</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4"></a>, 244 n. 191, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4"> <span class="page_number" data-page="279">*279</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="279">279</span>519 F.2d 821</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/buckley-v-valeo-4"></a>, 893 n. 191 (1975). The contention is that the FEC's enforcement power is not exclusive, because the Attorney General retains the traditional discretion to decline to institute legal proceedings. However this may be, the FEC's civil enforcement responsibilities are substantial.

( <i>Id.</i>, at 55.) It seeks to minimize the importance of the interplay by noting that its definitions of what is to be disclosed and reported would not be binding in judicial proceedings to determine whether substantive provisions of the Act had been violated, but would simply be extended a measure of deference as administrative interpretations. Appellants' reply is the practical one that, whether the FEC's power is substantive or not, persons violating its regulations do so at their peril. To illustrate the extent to which the FEC's regulations implicate the provisions of Title 18, appellants point to the FEC's interim guidelines for the New Hampshire and Tennessee special elections,40 Fed. Reg. 40668, 43660 (1975), and its regulations, rejected by the Senate, providing that funds contributed to and expended from the "office accounts" of Members of Congress were contributions or expenditures "subject to the limitations of 18 U.S.C. § 608,610, 611, 613, 614 and 615." See notice of proposed rulemaking, <i>id.</i>, at 32951. Unless the FEC's regulations are to be given no weight in criminal proceedings, it seems plain that through those regulations the FEC will have a significant role in the implementation and enforcement of criminal statutes.</p> </div><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">26.</div><p id="idp4068912-fn26" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 280 The FEC itself cannot fashion coercive relief by, for example, issuing cease-and-desist orders.

Indeed, except for the conduct of criminal proceedings, it would appear that the FEC has the entire responsibility for enforcement of the statutes at issue here. By no stretch of the imagination can its various functions in this respect be considered mere adjuncts to the legislative process or to the powers of Congress to judge the election and qualifications of its own members. </p> <p class="paragraph"> It is suggested, without accounting for the President's role in appointing some of its members, that the FEC would be willing to forgo its civil enforcement powers and that absent these functions, it is left with nothing that purely legislative officers may not do. The difficulty is that the statute invests the FEC not only with the authority but with the <i>duties</i> that unquestionably make its members officers of the United States, fully as much as the members of other commissions charged with the major responsibility for administering statutes. What is more, merely forgoing its authority to bring suit would still leave the FEC with the power to issue rules and regulations, its advisory opinion authority, and primary duties to enforce the Act. Absent notice and hearing by the FEC and a request on its part, it would not appear that the Executive Branch of the Government would have any authority under the statute to institute civil enforcement proceedings with respect to the reporting and disclosure requirements or the relevant provisions of Titles 18 and 26. </p> <p class="paragraph"> There is no doubt that the development of the administrative <span class="page_number" data-page="281">*281</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="281">281</span> agency in response to modern legislative and administrative need has placed severe strain on the separation-of-powers principle in its pristine formulation. See <i>Kilbourn</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/kilbourn-v-thompson?page=191">103 U.S. 168, 191</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/kilbourn-v-thompson?page=191"></a> (1881). Any notion that the Constitution bans any admixture of powers that might be deemed legislative, executive, and judicial has had to give way. The independent agency has survived attacks from various directions: that it exercises invalidly delegated legislative power, <i>Sunshine Coal Co</i>. v. <i>Adkins</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/sunshine-coal-co-v-adkins">310 U.S. 381</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/sunshine-coal-co-v-adkins"></a> (1940); that it invalidly exercises judicial power, <i>ibid.;</i> and that its functions are so executive in nature that its members must be subject to Presidential control, <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us">295 U.S. 602</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us"></a> (1935). Until now, however, it has not been insisted that the commands of the Appointments Clause must also yield to permit congressional appointments of members of a major agency. With the Court, I am not convinced that we should create a broad exception to the requirements of that Clause that all officers of the United States be appointed in accordance with its terms. The provision applies to all officers, however their duties may be classified; and even if some of the FEC's functions, such as rulemaking, are purely legislative, I know of no authority for the congressional appointment of its own agents to make binding rules and regulations necessary to or advisable for the administration and enforcement of a major statute where the President has not participated either in the appointment of each of the administrators or in the fashioning of the rules or regulations which they propound. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I do not dispute the legislative power of Congress coercively to gather and make available for public inspection massive amounts of information relevant to the legislative process. Its own officers may, as they have <span class="page_number" data-page="282">*282</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="282">282</span> done for years, receive and file contribution and expenditure reports of candidates and political committees. Arguably, the Commissioners, although not properly appointed by the President, should at least be able to perform this function. But the members of the FEC are appointed for definite terms of office, are not removable by the President or by Congress, and even if their duties were to be severely limited, they would appear to remain Art. II officers. In any event, the task of gathering and publishing campaign finance information has been one of the specialties of the officers of the respective Houses, and these same officers under the present law continue to receive such information and to act as custodians for the FEC, at least with respect to the Senate and House political campaigns. They are also instructed to cooperate with the FEC. § 438(d). </p> <p class="paragraph"> For these reasons I join in the Court's answers to certified questions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), 8(e) and 8(f), and with the following reservations to question 8(d). </p> <p class="paragraph"> Question 8(d) asks whether § 438(c) violates the constitutional rights of one or more of the plaintiffs in that "it empowers the Federal Election Commission to make rules under the F. E. C.A. in the manner specified therein." Section 438(c) imposes certain preconditions to the effectiveness of "any rule or regulation under this section . . .," but does not itself authorize the issuance of rules or regulations. That authorization is to be found in § 438(a) (10), which includes among the duties of the FEC the task of prescribing "rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c)." The "subchapter" referred to is the subchapter dealing with federal election campaigns and the reports of contributions and expenditures required to be filed with the FEC.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4083408-fn27">27 </a></sup> Subsection <span class="page_number" data-page="283">*283</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="283">283</span> (c), which is the provision expressly mentioned in question 8(d), requires that any rule or regulation prescribed by the FEC under § 438 shall be transmitted to the Senate or the House, or to both as thereafter directed.

No such requirement appears to exist with respect to the FEC's power to make "policy" with respect to the enforcement of the criminal provisions in Title 18 or with respect to any power it may have to issue rules and regulations dealing with the civil enforcement of those provisions.

As I understand it, the FEC's rules and regulations, whether or not issued in compliance with § 438(c), are invalid because the members of the FEC have not been appointed in accordance with Art. II. To the extent that this is the basis for the Court's answer to the question, I am in agreement. </p> <p class="paragraph"> If the FEC members had been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate as provided in Art. II, <span class="page_number" data-page="284">*284</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="284">284</span> nothing in the Constitution would prohibit Congress from empowering the Commission to issue rules and regulations without later participation by, or consent of, the President or Congress with respect to any particular rule or regulation or initially to adjudicate questions of fact in accordance with a proper interpretation of the statute. <i>Sunshine Coal Co</i>. v. <i>Adkins</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/sunshine-coal-co-v-adkins">310 U.S. 381</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/sunshine-coal-co-v-adkins"></a> (1940); <i>RFC</i> v. <i>Bankers Trust Co.</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/rfc-v-bankers-trust-co">318 U.S. 163</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/rfc-v-bankers-trust-co"></a> (1943); <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> v. <i>United States</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us">295 U.S. 602</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/humphreys-executor-v-us"></a> (1935). The President must sign the statute creating the rulemaking authority of the agency or it must have been passed over his veto, and he must have nominated the members of the agency in accordance with Art. II; but agency regulations issued in accordance with the statute are not subject to his veto even though they may be substantive in character and have the force of law. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I am also of the view that the otherwise valid regulatory power of a properly created independent agency is not rendered constitutionally infirm, as violative of the President's veto power, by a statutory provision subjecting agency regulations to disapproval by either House of Congress. For a bill to become law it must pass both Houses and be signed by the President or be passed over his veto. Also, "Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary . . ." is likewise subject to the veto power.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4093072-fn29">29 </a></sup> Under § 438(c) the FEC's regulations are subject to disapproval; but for a regulation to become effective, neither House need approve it, pass it, or take any action at all with respect to it. The regulation becomes effective by nonaction. This no more invades the President's powers than does a regulation not required to be laid before Congress. Congressional influence over the substantive content of agency regulation may be enhanced, <span class="page_number" data-page="285">*285</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="285">285</span> but I would not view the power of either House to disapprove as equivalent to legislation or to an order, resolution, or vote requiring the concurrence of both Houses.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4094656-fn30">30 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">29.</div><p id="idp4093072-fn29" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 284 U.S. Const., Art.

It is as though a bill passed in one House and failed in another.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> In terms of the substantive content of regulations and the degree of congressional influence over agency lawmaking, I do not suggest that there is no difference between the situation where regulations are subject to disapproval by Congress and the situation where the agency need not run the congressional gantlet. But the President's veto power, which gives him an important role in the legislative process, was obviously not considered an inherently <i>executive</i> function. Nor was its principal aim to provide another check against poor legislation. The major purpose of the veto power appears to have been to shore up the Executive Branch and to provide it with some bargaining and survival power against what the Framers feared would be the overweening power of legislators. As Hamilton said the veto power was to provide a defense against the legislative department's intrusion on the rights and powers of other departments; without such power, "the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands."<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4096736-fn31">31 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">31.</div><p id="idp4096736-fn31" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 285 The Federalist No. 73, pp. 468-469 (Wright ed. 1961).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> I would be much more concerned if Congress purported to usurp the functions of law enforcement, to control the outcome of particular adjudications, or to pre-empt the President's appointment power; but in the <span class="page_number" data-page="286">*286</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="286">286</span> light of history and modern reality, the provision for congressional disapproval of agency regulations does not appear to transgress the constitutional design, at least where the President has agreed to legislation establishing the disapproval procedure or the legislation has been passed over his veto. It would be considerably different if Congress itself purported to adopt and propound regulations by the action of both Houses. But here no action of either House is required for the agency rule to go into effect, and the veto power of the President does not appear to be implicated. </p> <p class="paragraph"> </p> </section><hr xmlns:akx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/ns/akn/3.0/CSD10"> <section xmlns:akx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/ns/akn/3.0/CSD10" class="decision dissent"> <p class="byline"> MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring in part and dissenting in part. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I join in all of the Court's opinion except Part I-C-2, which deals with 18 U.S.C. § 608 (a) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). That section limits the amount a candidate may spend from his personal funds, or family funds under his control, in connection with his campaigns during any calendar year. See <i>ante</i>, at 51-52, n. 57. The Court invalidates § 608(a) as violative of the candidate'sFirst Amendment rights. "[T]he First Amendment," the Court explains, "simply cannot tolerate § 608(a)'s restriction upon the freedom of a candidate to speak without legislative limit on behalf of his own candidacy." <i>Ante</i>, at 54. I disagree. </p> <p class="paragraph"> To be sure, § 608(a) affects the candidate's exercise of his First Amendment rights. But unlike the other expenditure limitations contained in the Act and invalidated by the Court — the limitation on independent expenditures relative to a clearly identified candidate, § 608(e), and the limitations on overall candidate expenditures, § 608(c) — the limitations on expenditures by candidates from personal resources contained in § 608(a) need never prevent the speaker from spending another <span class="page_number" data-page="287">*287</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="287">287</span> dollar to communicate his ideas. Section 608(a) imposes no overall limit on the amount a candidate can spend; it simply limits the "contribution" a candidate may make to his own campaign. The candidate remains free to raise an unlimited amount in contributions from others. So long as the candidate does not contribute to his campaign more than the amount specified in § 608(a), and so long as he does not accept contributions from others in excess of the limitations imposed by § 608(b), he is free to spend without limit on behalf of his campaign. </p> <p class="paragraph"> It is significant, moreover, that the ceilings imposed by § 608(a) on candidate expenditures from personal resources are substantially higher than the $1,000 limit imposed by § 608(e) on independent expenditures by noncandidates. Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates may contribute $50,000 of their own money to their campaigns, Senate candidates $35,000, and most House candidates $25,000. Those ceilings will not affect most candidates. But they will admittedly limit the availability of personal funds for some candidates, and the question is whether that limitation is justified. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Court views "[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates" as the relevant rationale for § 608(a), and deems that interest insufficient to justify § 608(a). <i>Ante</i>, at 54. In my view the interest is more precisely the interest in promoting the reality and appearance of equal access to the political arena. Our ballot-access decisions serve as a reminder of the importance of the general interest in promoting equal access among potential candidates. See, <i>e. g., Lubin</i> v. <i>Panish</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/lubin-v-panish">415 U.S. 709</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/lubin-v-panish"></a> (1974); <i>Bullock</i> v. <i>Carter</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/bullock-v-carter">405 U.S. 134</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/bullock-v-carter"></a> (1972). While admittedly those cases dealt with barriers to entry different from those we consider here, the barriers to which § 608(a) is directed <span class="page_number" data-page="288">*288</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="288">288</span> are formidable ones, and the interest in removing them substantial. </p> <p class="paragraph"> One of the points on which all Members of the Court agree is that money is essential for effective communication in a political campaign. It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant "headstart." Of course, the less wealthy candidate can potentially overcome the disparity in resources through contributions from others. But ability to generate contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial base for the campaign or some demonstration of pre-existing support, which in turn is facilitated by expenditures of substantial personal sums. Thus the wealthy candidate's immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can never overcome. And even if the advantage can be overcome, the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not only discourage potential candidates without significant personal wealth from entering the political arena, but also undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4166944-fn1">1 </a></sup> </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">1.</div><p id="idp4166944-fn1" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 288 "In the Nation's seven largest States in 1970, 11 of the 15 major senatorial candidates were millionaires. The four who were not millionaires lost their bid for election." 117 Cong. Rec. 42065 (1971) (remarks of Rep. Macdonald).</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> The concern that candidacy for public office not become, or appear to become, the exclusive province of the wealthy assumes heightened significance when one considers the impact of § 608(b), which the Court today upholds. That provision prohibits contributions from individuals and groups to candidates in excess of $1,000, and contributions from political committees in excess of $5,000. While the limitations on contributions are neutral in the sense that <span class="page_number" data-page="289">*289</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="289">289</span> all candidates are foreclosed from accepting large contributions, there can be no question that large contributions generally mean more to the candidate without a substantial personal fortune to spend on his campaign. Large contributions are the less wealthy candidate's only hope of countering the wealthy candidate's immediate access to substantial sums of money. With that option removed, the less wealthy candidate is without the means to match the large initial expenditures of money of which the wealthy candidate is capable. In short, the limitations on contributions put a premium on a candidate's personal wealth. </p> <p class="paragraph"> In view of § 608(b)'s limitations on contributions, then, § 608(a) emerges not simply as a device to reduce the natural advantage of the wealthy candidate, but as a provision providing some symmetry to a regulatory scheme that otherwise enhances the natural advantage of the wealthy.<sup class="note-disclosure"><a href="#idp4170384-fn2">2 </a></sup> Regardless of whether the goal of equalizing access would justify a legislative limit on personal candidate expenditures standing by itself, I think it clear that that goal justifies § 608(a)'s limits when they are considered in conjunction with the remainder of the <span class="page_number" data-page="290">*290</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="290">290</span> Act. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's invalidation of § 608(a). </p><div class="note-container"><div class="note-marker">2.</div><p id="idp4170384-fn2" class="note"> </p><p class="paragraph"> Page 289 Of course, § 608(b)'s enhancement of the wealthy candidate's natural advantage does not require its invalidation. As the Court demonstrates, § 608(b) is fully justified by the governmental interest in limiting the reality and appearance of corruption. <i>Ante</i>, at 26-29. <br> In addition to § 608(a), § 608(c), which limits overall candidate expenditures in a campaign, also provides a check on the advantage of the wealthy candidate. But we today invalidate that section, which unlike § 608(a) imposes a flat prohibition on candidate expenditures above a certain level, and which is less tailored to the interest in equalizing access than § 608(a). The effect of invalidating both § 608(c) and § 608(a) is to enable the wealthy candidate to spend his personal resources without limit, while his less wealthy opponent is forced to make do with whatever amount he can accumulate through relatively small contributions.</p> </div> <p class="paragraph"> </p> </section><hr xmlns:akx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/ns/akn/3.0/CSD10"> <section xmlns:akx="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/ns/akn/3.0/CSD10" class="decision dissent"> <p class="byline"> MR.

The statute before us was enacted by Congress, not with the aim of managing the Government's property nor of regulating the conditions of Government employment, but rather with a view to the regulation of the citizenry as a whole. The case for me, then, presents theFirst Amendment interests of the appellants at their strongest, and the legislative authority of Congress in the position where it is most vulnerable to First Amendment attacks. <span class="page_number" data-page="292">*292</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="292">292</span> </p> <p class="paragraph"> While this approach undoubtedly differs from some of the underlying assumptions in the opinion of the Court, opinions are written not to explore abstract propositions of law but to decide concrete cases. I therefore join in all of the Court's opinion except Part III-B-1, which sustains, against appellants' First andFifth Amendment challenges, the disparities found in the congressional plan for financing general Presidential elections between the two major parties, on the one hand, and minor parties and candidacies on the other. </p> <p class="paragraph"> While I am not sure that I agree with the Court's comment, <i>ante</i>, at 95, that "public financing is generally less restrictive of access to the electoral process than the ballot-access regulations dealt with in prior cases," in any case that is not, under my view, an adequate answer to appellants' claim. The electoral laws relating to ballot access which were examined in <i>Lubin</i> v. <i>Panish</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/lubin-v-panish?page=716">415 U.S. 709, 716</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/lubin-v-panish?page=716"></a> (1974); <i>American Party of Texas</i> v. <i>White</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/american-party-of-texas-v-white?page=780">415 U.S. 767, 780</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/american-party-of-texas-v-white?page=780"></a> (1974); and <i>Storer</i> v. <i>Brown</i>, <a class="raw-ref" href="/case/storer-v-brown-frommhagen-v-brown-8212-812-72-8212-6050?page=729">415 U.S. 724, 729</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/storer-v-brown-frommhagen-v-brown-8212-812-72-8212-6050?page=729"></a> 730 (1974), all arose out of state efforts to regulate minor party candidacies and the actual physical size of the ballot. If the States are to afford a republican form of government, they must by definition provide for general elections and for some standards as to the contents of the official ballots which will be used at those elections. The decision of the state legislature to enact legislation embodying such regulations is therefore not in any sense an optional one; there must be some standards, however few, which prescribe the contents of the official ballot if the popular will is to be translated into a choice among candidates. Dealing thus by necessity with these issues, the States have strong interests in "limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate substantial popular support," <i>ante</i>, at 96. They have a like interest in discouraging <span class="page_number" data-page="293">*293</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="293">293</span> "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism" which might proliferate the number of candidates on a state ballot so as to make it virtually unintelligible to the average voter. <i>Storer</i> v. <i>Brown, supra</i>, at 736. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Congress, on the other hand, while undoubtedly possessing the legislative authority to undertake the task if it wished, is not obliged to address the question of public financing of Presidential elections at all. When it chooses to legislate in this area, so much of its action as may arguably impair First Amendment rights lacks the same sort of mandate of necessity as does a State's regulation of ballot access. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Congress, of course, does have an interest in not "funding hopeless candidacies with large sums of public money," <i>ante</i>, at 96, and may for that purpose legitimately require "`some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support,' <i>Jenness</i> v. <i>Fortson</i>, [<a class="raw-ref" href="/case/jenness-v-fortson?page=442">403 U.S. 431,442</a><a class="little-gray-box" reference="/case/jenness-v-fortson?page=442"></a> (1971),] as an eligibility requirement for public funds." <i>Ante</i>, at 96. But Congress in this legislation has done a good deal more than that. It has enshrined the Republican and Democratic Parties in a permanently preferred position, and has established requirements for funding minor-party and independent candidates to which the two major parties are not subject. Congress would undoubtedly be justified in treating the Presidential candidates of the two major parties differently from minor-party or independent Presidential candidates, in view of the long demonstrated public support of the former. But because of the First Amendment overtones of the appellants' Fifth Amendment equal protection claim, something more than a merely rational basis for the difference in treatment must be shown, as the Court apparently recognizes. I find it impossible to subscribe to the Court's reasoning that because no third party has posed a credible threat to the two major parties in Presidential <span class="page_number" data-page="294">*294</span><span class="page_number_margin" data-page="294">294</span> elections since 1860, Congress may by law attempt to assure that this pattern will endure forever. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I would hold that, as to general election financing, Congress has not merely treated the two major parties differently from minor parties and independents, but has discriminated in favor of the former in such a way as to run afoul of the Fifth and First Amendments to the United States Constitution. </p> </section>
